      <h1>The Encoding/Encryption System</h1>
      <p>Many of the SnippetMaster program files are &quot;encoded&quot; (encrypted) 
        with either <strong>Ioncube Encoder</strong> or <strong>Zend Encoder/Safeguard</strong>. 
        <font size="1" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">(Unfortunately, 
        this encryption is necessary because several people stole the source code 
        from me previously when I left it &quot;open&quot;, and now I must encrypt 
        it to protect myself from thieves. Sorry!)</font> 
      <p>A common error you might encounter
        when trying to run SnippetMaster for the first time is if your server
        is not yet set up with the ability to &quot;decode&quot; (unencrypt) the files.
        A
        typical
        error
        might
        look
        something
        like this:
      <blockquote> 
        <p><strong>Ioncube</strong><br>
          The file /path/to/snippetmaster/index.php has been encoded with the 
          ionCube PHP Encoder and requires the free ioncube_loader_xyz_4.3.so 
          ionCube PHP Loader to be installed.</p>
        <p><strong>Zend</strong><br>
          Fatal error: Unable to read 887 bytes in /home/username/public_html/snippetmaster/index.php 
          on line 0 </p>
        </blockquote>
      <p>If you see this sort of error, then it means you must &quot;install&quot; 
        the required &quot;loader&quot; file and then everything will start to 
        work.</p>
      <p>Note: I am only going to explain how to get the Ioncube encoding system 
        working here. The Zend version will have to wait. (But be sure you're 
        uploading the files in BINARY mode.)</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>What is an &quot;ioncube loader&quot; file?</strong> The
            &quot;loader&quot; file is the file that has all the decryption commands for
          your server's
            operating system and version of PHP. The problem is that there are
          dozens of different operation systems and versions of PHP, and each
          combination
          needs
          a different &quot;loader&quot; file. </p>
        <p>Loader files for the most popular operating
            systems and PHP versions are already included inside the /snippetmaster/ioncube/
            folder, but
            if you have a &quot;less-common&quot; operating system or PHP version then
          you might need to visit the ioncube website and download the necessary
             &quot;loader&quot; file.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3>It's Easy!</h3>
      <p>The first place to start is by going to the following file with your
        web browser:</p>
      <p><strong>http://<font color="#009900">www.yourdomain.com</font>/<font color="#FF0000">snippetmaster</font>/ioncube/ioncube-loader-helper.php</strong></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><font color="#009900">www.yourdomain.com</font> = your own domain name<br>
          <font color="#FF0000">snippetmaster</font> = the name of the program
            folder where the SnippetMaster files are located </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>This will run a quick diagnostic  and probably tell you  the required
        &quot;loader&quot; is not installed. There are several options to install the required
        file, but the easiest is to use &quot;run-time loading&quot;. </p>
      <p>You should look for
          the text that says something like this:</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>If you do not have access to the php.ini file, please follow the <font color="#0000FF">run-time
          loading installation instructions</font>.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Now you should click the <font color="#0000FF">run-time loading installation
      instructions</font> link and follow the instructions indicated. Typically,
      you will need to go to the ioncube.com website, download a specific &quot;loader
      file&quot; (for your operating system and version of PHP), and then upload it
      into your /snippetmaster/ioncube folder.
