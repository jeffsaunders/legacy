<!--				More than a decade ago an enthusiastic entrepreneur in Fort Worth, Texas set out with a goal. To meet the growing need to manage and control safe working environments, primarily in the arena of sanding and grinding where, across the spectrum, hazardous dust was being ingested by operators. Companies in an effort to meet safety standards set by regulatory agencies, were searching for cost-effective methods and easy-to-use tools.</p>

				<p>DCM Clean-Air<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> was founded to manufacture the first ever, patented, abrasive Vacu-Disc<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> and Vacu-Holders<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup>.</p>

				<p>DCM Clean-Air<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> is recognized not only as the forerunner of dust collection technology, but is the premier manufacturer of &quot;POINT of GENERATION&quot; ergonomic Vacu-Tools<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> and Vacu-Systems<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup>. The continual expansion to our line has added applications for drilling, routing, sawing, countersinking, mig welding, grinding and sanding.</p>

				<p>We are always looking for new challenges and love to work on special applications. We are very flexible and, in most instances, can easily make modifications to meet your specific requirements.</p>

				<p>DCM Clean-Air's<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> steady growth, based upon innovation, technology and responsiveness to customers, has continued for more than 10 years. As we enter into the new millennium we will continue with dedication to business and customers, and stand positioned to meet challenges and opportunities quickly and effectively.</p>

				<strong>In 1988, Doug Chilton walked through an F-18 hangar and saw two guys in full hazmat suits completing repair on the bird.  Spraying hazardous dust everywhere, Doug, at that moment, caught a vision for a solution.  That moment is what lead to the invention of our patented dust collecting systems and the opportunity to significantly reduce the exposure to life threatening dust in facilities across America and overseas.</strong></p>
				
				<p>Doug was a prolific entrepreneur, businessman, inventor and mentor who founded a number of successful companies in a variety of industries. Most notably, he developed a patent for dust collection systems widely used in aerospace. The systems are at the forefront of environmental safety and will continue to be a leading product of the enduring business he founded, DCM Clean Air Products of Fort Worth. Doug had a passion for life and brought joy and excitement to everything he did with his contagious laugh that will never be forgotten by all those he knew and loved.</p>
