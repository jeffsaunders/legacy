<!--				
				<p>DCM Clean-Air<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> Products, Inc. is the pioneer and leader in the design and manufacturing of systems for power hand tools designed for source capture of hazardous airborne dust at the &quot;POINT of GENERATION.&quot; DCM's innovative and patented designs for source capture systems provide the highest levels of breathing zone protection and ease of use for the operators. The core of our business lies in the retrofit of most brand name power tools. Source capture at &quot;POINT of GENERATION&quot; is offered with our complete line of sanders, grinders, drills, routers, scalers, power brushes, cut-off and trim saws, roto peens and our Worbst<sup><font size="1">TM</font></sup> smoke and fume extraction systems for MIG welding applications.</p> 
	
				<p>Our line also includes portable pneumatic and electric vacuums designed specifically for hazardous dust source capture. Our vacuums are the most powerful portable vacuums on the market and are available with or without HEPA filtration.</p> 
	
				<p>For those companies or individuals that have used dust collection systems before and have found them to be ineffective, cumbersome or more trouble than they are worth, we offer the following invitation. Let one of our trained technicians schedule a hands-on demonstration of our products in your facility in your working environment. We can safely say that if you do not find the DCM dust collection systems to be the easiest to use and most effective in reducing the incidence of hazardous airborne particulate then you will never be using dust collection systems as part of your work.</p> 
	
				<p>We are confident enough in our products to state that &quot;you have tried the rest &ndash; now try the best.&quot;</p>
