				Don't toss them in the landfill &mdash; recycle them!</strong><br>

				<p>Currently, the useful life of a computer is only 3 to 5 years and shrinking. In 2005, the National Safety Council projects more than 63 million personal computers are expected to retire.</p>

				<p>If you have old, outdated electronic products (e.g., personal computers, peripherals, laptops, monitors, fax machines and copiers) in your office or home, you're not alone. According to the Institute for Local Self-Reliance, approximately 75 percent of obsolete electronics are currently being stored or warehoused without any idea on the best way to handle these materials.</p>

				<p>Electronic products can contain over a dozen hazardous or toxic materials. The cathode ray tube (CRTs) in monitors can be up to 27 percent lead, and in a form that can leach into the water table if dumped in a landfill. Other chemicals such as cadmium and lithium (in rechargeable batteries), mercury (in switches and lamps) as well as chromium and antimony can be found in amounts that may cause them to test hazardous under Federal law.</p>

				<p>Many electronic products contain parts that could be profitably refurbished and reused with little effort. When we throw away old electronic equipment, we're throwing away these resources and generating additional pollution associated with the need to access virgin materials and manufacture new products.</p>

				<p>Technological advances are rapidly rendering formerly cutting-edge electronics obsolete. An estimated 20 million personal computers became obsolete in 1988. Most of these are in storage. Of the remainder less than 6 percent was recycled.</p>

				<p><strong>Is a Computer an Asset or a Liability?</strong></p>

				<p>When it comes to the computer's end-of-life, the answer is easy: <strong>liability!</strong></p>

				<p>A computer contains information. Exposing that information can cause damage to a variety of agents. Furthermore, that information is protected by law. The process of clearing information from the hard drive, beyond recovery, is called: <strong>"Hard Drive Sanitization"</strong>. Evidence that the hard drive was sanitized is called: <strong>"Certificate of Destruction"</strong>.</p>

				<strong>Motivations for Hard Drive Sanitization</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>Losing Customers' Trust, Reputation</li>
					<li>Security and Privacy</li>
					<li>Risk Management</li>
					<li>Acquiring a Certification of Data Destruction</li>
					<li>Disposing oversized storages of your old electronics</li>
					<li>Environmental factors</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Compliance</strong></p>
				<p>Laws and regulations make organizations responsible for their employees' and customers' information, and require proper disposal of the hard drives. Laws include: <strong>HIPPA, FACTA, SBA, GLBA, PIPEDA, SEC Rule 17a, Californa Senate Bill 1386</strong>.</p>

				<p><strong>The Challenges</strong></p>
				<p>Federal agencies such as DoD, DSS and NIST set standards on how to protect and sanitize electronic information. Yet, developing and implementing protocols in your organization easily becomes a sophisticated task. <strong>Robert Varmosi</strong>, the senior editor of <strong>CNET Review</strong> wrote: <em>"the process is mind-numbing and subject to human error… There is no way to easily visually check that erasure has successfully occurred"</em>.</p>

				<p><strong>The Blind Center and You</strong></p>
				<p>Different organizations are subject to compliance with distinctive laws. The Blind Center of Nevada will customize a solution for you, based on the sensitivity of your data, field of operation, location (state), status and more.</p>

				<p><strong>The Blind Center of Nevada</strong> is a national leader in the field of Hard Drive Sanitization. We provide data destruction solutions to numerous customers including: State and Local Nevada Government Agencies, Hospitals, Utilities, Banks, Legal Firms and Commercial Businesses.</p><br>
