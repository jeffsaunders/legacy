		Audrey Bascum Tait founded The Las Vegas Blind Center in 1955. It began as a simple group of visually impaired people gathering on Audrey&#146;s back porch. When the group became too big for the porch, Audrey convinced the Lion&#146;s Club to help her find another location. In 1959 the Lion&#146;s Club gave the Center a two-room building at 1001 Bruce Street. That location has been the Center&#146;s home ever since.<br>
		<br>
		Through out the years the Center has steadily grown and has evolved into a multi-faceted organization with an array of services and programs that address the needs of people with visual impairments.<br>
		<br>
		In keeping pace with the changing needs of the community, the Center recently began a revitalization program. In May, 2000 the Center changed its name to ISIGHT, Inc. and elected a new Board of Directors. The new Board is made up of active members of the legal, business and medical community dedicated to facilitate the growth of the Center. Working along side the Board of Directors is an advisory committee comprised of clients from the Center. The advisory committee adds a special dimension to the framework of the Center.<br>
		<br>
		In May of 2002, it was decided that a name more reflective of the center's purpose would help bring a stronger identity to the mission, so the name was officially changed to Blind Center of Nevada.<br>
		<br>
		Nevada has one of the fastest growing communities in the country and has had the highest percentage growth of seniors in the United States for the past decade. The incidence of age-related blindness is growing dramatically. Nevada State Services for the Blind estimates there are approximately 20,000 people in Las Vegas with a visual impairment.<br>
		<br>
		The challenge of the Board of Directors is to lay the groundwork to begin the new century with a new hope for those who are visually impaired. To meet the challenge, the Center has embarked on a mission to create public awareness, get the community involved, elevate the Center to the next level, actively pursue meaningful employment and job development for the visually impaired, and to improve their quality of life.
