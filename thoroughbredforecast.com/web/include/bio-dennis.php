		Dennis Tobler is a fixture in the sports gaming and horse race handicapping business in Las Vegas.  A life-long sports participant and sports &amp; horse race bettor, the Nebraska-born and football-bred Tobler has been one of the country's top handicappers. He is one of a handful of experts who help set the betting line in Las Vegas and offshore. Having begun his carrer in 1972, his sources run very deep in this close knit business.<br><br>
		During the 1960's Dennis was a two-time all-state football player in Nebraska, where they really know their football! Through the 1970's he managed to break nearly every private bookmaker in the Midwest and by 1980 Dennis was ready to move his tack to the "show" - the bright lights of Las Vegas.<br><br> 
		In 1982, Dennis founded his Las Vegas based sports information service, one of only four licensed services at the time, to sell sports and horse racing handicapping information through "800," "900," and "976" telephone services.<br><br>
		Not one to sit on his laurals, in 1988 Dennis formed the TSI Network to begin production and syndication of <strong>Football Forecast Weekly</strong> (<a href="http://www.footballforecast.com" target="_blank" class="bodyBlack">footballforecast.com</a>), his first nationally syndicated television show.  Soon after the show's launch, the Orange County Register (Anaheim, CA) dubbed it the <em>"BEST SHOW EVER when it comes to imparting football information."</em>  The show's popularity immediately soared and Dennis soon began producing <strong>Thoroughbred Racing Forecast</strong>, a series of horse racing specials to compliment <strong>Football Forecast Weekly</strong>.<br><br>
		After nearly 20 years, <strong>Football Forecast Weekly</strong> is still going strong and is now one of the longest running programs of it's type.  Dennis is now one of the most sought after celebrities in the business and has appeared as the principle talent on over 220 nationally televised shows and thousands of radio programs.  His unmatched expertise is the reason he has become a consultant to many sports books around the world.<br><br>
		Since the birth of offshore gaming, Dennis has become a major player in all aspects of this growth industry, from consulting on software and business setup to leveraging his television production talents and actually producing television programs in Antigua, St. Kitts, Curacao, and of course, Costa Rica.<br><br>
		Dennis retired from public handicapping in 2005 and now concentrates on his racing stable and wagering in Las Vegas. He also enjoys dabbling in real estate and development both in Las Vegas and abroad.<br><br>
		In 2006, Dennis co-founded <!--partnered with Mitch and Susan Hammons to start the <a href="?sec=stable" class="bodyBlack">-->M&amp;S Racing Stable</a>, dedicated to claiming and purchasing race horses for the fun of <em>"The Sport of Kings!"</em><br><br>
<!--		In 2009, Dennis launched <a href="?sec=stable" class="bodyBlack">Wise Guys Racing Stable</a> and has re-acquired "Carson's Copper" - watch for him at the races now!<br><br>-->
		In 2012, Dennis launched Wise Guys Racing Stable and has began to purchase stock for racing syndication. Current prospects are listed on the <a href="?sec=stable" class="bodyBlack">Wise Guys link</a>, watch for them at the races now!<br><br>
		More than ever, now is the time to invest in Thoroughbred Racing.  For more information contact Dennis directly at <a href="mailto:dennis@thoroughbredforecast.com" class="bodyBlack" style="text-decoration:underline">dennis@thoroughbredforecast.com</a>.
