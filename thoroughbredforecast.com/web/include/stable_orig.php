		The Hammons are uniquely qualified for such a venture; not only are they avid horse racing fans and both excellent handicappers, they also have first-hand experience in every aspect of thoroughbred race horse ownership.<br><br>

		Mitch & Susan are not merely horse owners, but have been involved with pinhooking, two-year-old sales, syndicates, and partnerships and have the necessary connections at the track to make M&S Stable a success immediately.<br><br>

		The Hammons' mantra for the stable is <strong>"Let's Have Fun!"</strong>  While some syndicates and partnerships inflate costs for their investors, from the start, with outrageous syndication mark ups and tremendous monthly bills, M&S operates differently. Each investor in the M&S Racing model has access to a complete open book of the operations as well as input and access to the particular program(s) they are involved in, whether it be a two-year-old syndicate or a claim to race immediately.<br>
