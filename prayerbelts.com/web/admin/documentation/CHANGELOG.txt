- Fixed small problem with language file not displaying properly.


[ November 11, 2005 -- v2.0 ]

+  ** MAJOR CHANGE! ** Changed the snippet tag system so now it is standards
   compliant and uses HTML comments instead of pseudo-HTML tags.
   If you are upgrading from a previous version, you MUST modify every page
   that contains the old snippet tags and change them like this:

   Change:  <snippet name="snippet name">
       To:  <!-- #BeginSnippet name="snippet name" -->

   Change:  </snippet>
       To:  <!-- #EndSnippet -->

+  MUTIPLE SNIPPETS ON ONE PAGE. With the ability to now have multiple 
   snippets on a single page, it is mandatory to give each snippet a name. A
   #BeginSnippet tag without a valid name will not be recognized.

+  EXCLUDE or INCLUDE folders. Added the ability to specify a list of folders 
   to either include or exclude from appearing in the WYSIWYG browse list 
   when adding/editing a link or image. You can specify either include or 
   exclude for each list.

+  MULITPLE USERS! PRO version now supports unlimited users. Each user 
   can have their own "starting folder", so you can limit any user to certain 
   areas of your website. I will be adding additional features to this, so 
   please let me know your suggestions.  (ie: Ability to specify 
   "exclude/include" folders on a "per user" basis?)

+  DEMONSTRATION MODE. Useful for anyone who wants to install a fully working
   demo of the software on their website, but doesn't want their customers 
   to be able to save file changes. Set "$DEMO_MODE = 1" in config.inc.php.

+  Added ability to upload files without opening the WYSIWYG editor.

+  Added support for a list of "editable file types". Only files in this
   list will be allowed for editing.

+  Added function so users with admin priviledge can edit an entire file, 
   even if there are no snippets in the file.

*  Improved error checking for saving files from the editor.

*  Improved file upload system so that it checks to see if the uploaded file is 
   readable by the "nobody/www" user.  If not, it tries to chmod 644 the file.

*  Changed upload system so that valid file extensions ($VALID_UPLOAD_FILE_TYPES)
   are now case insensitive.

*  Major code cleanup to make things faster and more effecient.

+  Added check to make sure file was not modified by someone else while user was 
   editing.  Error will be displayed if current timestamp is newer then timestamp
   taken when file was opened for editing.

+  Added ability to support unlimited number of websites on a single server with
   one license key. Contact me if you're interested in using the PRO version
   for an unlimited number of sites on one server.

*  Login form cursor goes to username box automatically.

*  Removed debug system since it was useless and just added clutter to my life.

+  Removed ability for admin to disable authentication. Since some settings are
   now user-specific, we MUST have a user login to use the program.

+  Added automatic session expiry if no action has been taken within a certain
   duration.  This is for improved security since many users use the program
   on a shared computer and forget to logout!

+  POWER USERS.  Users with power priviledges can edit ANY snippet.

+  ADMIN USERS.  Users with admin priviledges can edit ANY snippet and ANY 
   editable file, even if there are no snippets in it.
   USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Please note that the current WYSIWYG editor sucks
   and it will really screw up your files if you try to edit a whole file and
   it contains any complicated html code.  It will also screw up your snippet 
   tags.  (By causing them to no longer be on their own line after saving.)

-  Fixed problem with upload utility when selected language was not being
   remembered after file was uploaded.




[ January 3, 2005 -- v1.2.7 ]

+ Added a "demonstration mode". Usefull for anyone who wants to install
  a fully working demo of the software on their website, but doesn't 
  want their customers to be able to save file changes.
  Set "$DEMO_MODE = 1" in config.inc.php file to enable.
  Modified files:
	/includes/config.inc.php (added $DEMO_MODE variable)

  IE options enabled.  (Location bar, toolbar, menu bar, status bar, etc..)  
  So now you can force a refresh if IE doesn't do it automatically.

[ September 4, 2002 -- version 1.0.1 ]
- Removed needless call that was left over from debugging.
