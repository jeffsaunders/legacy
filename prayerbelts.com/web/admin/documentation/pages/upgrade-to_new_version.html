      <h1><B>U</B><B>pgrading From A Previous Version</B></h1>
      <p> If you are currently using SnippetMaster version <strong>1.x</strong> 
        and you want to upgrade to the latest version (<strong>2.x</strong>), 
        then here are the instructions.</p>
      <h3>Backup your existing config.inc.php file</h3>
      <p>The first thing you should do is log into your web server and make a 
        backup of your <strong>/snippetmaster/includes/config.inc.php</strong> 
        file. Save this file to your computer and keep it safe. You shouldn't 
        need it for anything, but it will be handy as a reference when you're 
        setting up all the options in the new <a href="admin-overview.html"> Admin 
        Area</a>.</p>
      <h3>Backup ALL files</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Make a backup of your entire <strong>/snippetmaster</strong> folder. 
          If you're using some kind of hosting control panel, then you might need 
          to backup your entire account. Whatever you need to do.. do it now so 
          that you have a backup of your existing installation. This is a &quot;just 
          in case&quot; safety precaution.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>OK, now lets get started.</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Using your FTP program, log into your web server and rename your existing 
          <strong>/snippetmaster </strong>folder to something else. (ie: <strong>/snippetmaster<em>-old</em></strong>) 
          Once the new version is installed and you are happy with how it works, 
          then you can delete this folder.<br>
          <br>
          <strong>Note: </strong>The new version is significantly different then 
          the old version, and none of the old program files are used. Once you 
          are happy with how the new version is working, you can delete the old 
          version -- it is no longer needed. </li>
        <li>Go through the <a href="install-getting-started.html">Getting Started</a> 
          steps.</li>
        <li>Go through the <a href="install-wizard.html">Install Wizard</a>.</li>
        <li>Now comes the hard part. Normally, new users would be instructed to 
          <a href="snippet-tags-basic-config.html">start adding snippet tags to 
          their files</a>. However, you already <em>have</em> snippet tags in 
          your files... <strong><br>
          <br>
          ... the problem is that they are no longer correct.</strong></li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a name="newtag"></a>The Snippet Tag System Has Changed</h3>
      <p>Every file that currently has snippet tags will need to be changed. The 
        old method of specifying the &quot;snippet&quot; of text that is to be 
        editable is now different. Unfortunately, this major change was required 
        in order to make the snippet tags fully HTML standards compliant and work 
        with all browsers and webpage editors.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p>Please take a few minutes to visit the <a href="snippet-tags-basic-config.html">Basic 
          Configuration</a> page and the <a href="snippet-tag-attributes.html">Advanced 
          Snippet Tag Attributes</a> page for details on how the new snippet tags 
          work.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Here is what you must do:</strong></p>
      <ol>
        <li> Change any occurance of: <br>
          <br>
          <strong><font color="#CC6600">&lt;snippet name=&quot;snippet name&quot;&gt;<br>
          <br>
          </font></strong><em>or</em><strong><font color="#CC6600"><br>
          <br>
          &lt;snippet&gt; </font></strong><br>
          <br>
          to: <br>
          <font color="#009900"><br>
          <strong>&lt;!-- #BeginSnippet name=&quot;snippet name&quot; --&gt;<br>
          </strong></font></li>
        <li> Change any occurance of: <br>
          <br>
          <strong><font color="#CC6600">&lt;/snippet&gt;</font></strong><br>
          <br>
          To:<br>
          <br>
          <strong><font color="#009900">&lt;!-- #EndSnippet --&gt;</font></strong></li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you only have a few files, then I encourage you to make these required 
        changes manually. However, if you have many snippet files, then you might 
        want to use an automated &quot;search &amp; replace&quot; utility to make 
        the changes for you.</p>
