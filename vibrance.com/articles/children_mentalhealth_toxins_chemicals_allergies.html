<strong>By motivating your children</strong> to eat properly, you are giving them an important gift - the gift of health and happiness.  Spend time educating your children.  Most parents allow the <strong>TV</strong> to <strong>baby-sit</strong> for up to 4 or more hours per day, seven days a week.  The average child sees more than 20,000 commercials a year, and by the age of 21, over one million commercials!  Children tend to believe commercials and need to be taught the difference and the truth.  Nine out of ten ads on Saturday morning TV are for greasy, fatty, high cholesterol, sugar loaded junk food.  Childrens programming contains an average of 26 violent acts per hour, while prime time has five acts of violence.  Teens see over 100,000 ads for alcohol before drinking age.  Advertisers spend over $800 million a year on ads aimed at kids.  Children under 12 and teenagers influence their parents to spend over $160 billion a year.  Watch TV with your children and talk about the misleading advertising.  You may be able to extend the quality of their lives and of their offspring in coming generations.  Won’t you help reduce the rate of obesity, heart disease and cancer in children by getting to the cause of the problem?  
<p><dd>
I'm sure you want to introduce your children to the proper way of eating.  Here is an excellent guide for infant food introduction.  At birth, you will want to start the child off with breast-feeding.  Breast milk is the only recommended food for the infant.  You can breast feed the child to eighteen months and some children are breast fed until the age of two or a little longer.  If for some reason, you cannot give the baby breast milk, you should contact La Leche League or some group that would help you to obtain breast milk.  It is very important infants be breast fed to build up their immune system, to give proper nutrition and to avoid the danger of sudden infant death syndrome or crib death.  If you must introduce a formula, soy-milk formula such as Isomil, Prosoybee or Similac would be safer than one based on cow's milk.  
<p><dd>
At six to seven months, you can introduce fresh fruits, such as bananas or peaches.  Blend them so that the baby will enjoy them.  Some basic baby foods available are good, just look for no added sugar.  At seven months, you can give the baby cooked green vegetables, sprouts and a little bit of avocado, along with a liquid vitamin.  By the eight month you can introduce other cooked vegetables, yams, carrots and squash.  At the tenth month the baby will thrive on tuber vegetables including potatoes and brown rice cereal with rice or soy milk.  At twelve months try adding various types of legumes and beans.   At fourteen months you can start feeding the baby the variety of soups an salads  that the family eats pureed from your meals.  
<p><dd>
The same diet that is good for you will be good for your baby.  Don't get in the habit of feeding meat, dairy, eggs and fatty foods to your child just because you were raised on them.  You'll never break the chain that way!  You'll raise a baby that will have health problems, probably be overweight and not the opportunity that you have now following a good diet.  Our children are precious to us and we must make the decision to adopt a healthy way of eating.  If you start them on this plan from birth their taste buds will be adopted to proper nutrition. I believe that most people eat sugar and fatty foods not so much because they like them, but because they become conditioned to eating them.  Healthy eating started early helps to avoid poor nutrition habits later.  
<p><dd>
When your children approach their adolescent and teen years, they are obviously going to be exposed to the fatty, greasy foods.  Don't worry if they occasionally eat these foods, because occasional use will not cause any harm.  But, if they fall into a pattern of eating high cholesterol, high fat foods regularly, then talk with your child about making better choices.  Treat them like an adult and speak to them intelligently.  They will respect you and if you find out what fruits and vegetables, grains, rice and legumes they like best so you can work around their diet.  As the children are growing they need large amounts of sprouted seeds, legumes, vegetables, potatoes, and fruit and rice for growth and energy.  Give them smaller amounts of fish or soy products because they are concentrated  in food density and calories.  
<p><dd>
Whole, natural foods also provide all the protein needed for a growing child.  We have been brought up with the idea that dairy and meats are the high sources of protein.  All foods have protein – aspargus, broccoli, potatoes, rice, corn and spaghetti squash are just a few examples of foods that are excellent sources of protein.  Almost all foods have a natural source of fat (sprouted seeds, soaked seeds, oatmeal), too.  Unfortunately, we have all been conditioned to use excess sources of protein.  
<p><dd>
Ask your children what they like to eat.  Make a thorough list - there may be some healthy foods you didn't know they do like!  For example, your young child or teenagers list may include the following:
<p><dd>
Nicholas <strong>will</strong> eat:
<ol>
<li value="1">Old-fashioned oatmeal
<li value="2">Potatoes
<li value="3">Rice, Quick Brown
<li value="4">Salad
<li value="5">Tortillas
<li value="6">Beans - burritos
<li value="7">Oranges
<li value="8">Apples
<li value="9">Bananas
<li value="10">Grapes
<li value="11">Soup
<li value="12">Corn
<li value="13">Soy or Rice Cheese and ice cream
</ol>
<p><dd>
Nicholas <strong>will Avoid</strong> eating:
<ol>
<li value="1">Cheese
<li value="2">Milk
<li value="3">Meat
<li value="4">Chicken
<li value="5">Oils
<li value="6">Candy
<li value="7">Dairy based ice cream
<li value="8">Eggs
</ol>
<p><dd>
Weekly <strong>REWARD</strong> for good food choices: go to the park or swimming. 
<p><dd>
The above list comes from my son Nicholas, who was 7 years old at the time of this writing.  He is not always perfect in adherence to this list.  However, my son has a clear understanding of the purpose and the objective of good nutrition.  I also supply Nicholas with additional motivation to stick to his diet by doing something he enjoys.  Also, I rent him his favorite video games when his compliance is particularly good. Generally, it’s best to choose rewards that involve some kind of physical activity or outdoor outing the children enjoy.   
<p><dd>
Obviously, Cherish, Jason, and Lance have a different list of foods they like to eat, foods they must avoid, and rewards they want if they comply with a Grow Young & Slim diet, supplements and exercise plan.  It’s never too early or too late  to start your children on a health plan they will be able to follow for the rest of their lives.  What a wonderful gift you are offering your children, the opportunity to prevent most all diseases, and live a long, healthy, happy life.
<p><dd>
Don't ruin your children's motivation by sneaking in bad food and leaving it in the refrigerator.  Food selection should be an example set by the parents.  If you provide those nutritious foods in the cupboards and the refrigerator, your children will nibble on them instead of the greasy, fattening foods so prevalent today.  Try having a pot of cooked brown rice, whole grain brown rice spaghetti squash, salads or soups ready for your family to snack on during the day.  You can make whole grain pizza (NO CHEESE!) with mushrooms, tomatoes, bell peppers, pineapple or any other vegetables your children enjoy.  You may need to motivate your children to eat properly by using some reward system.  You might promise to go to a football game with them, or rent them a tape they want to see, go to a movie or get them a collector card.   
<p><dd>
A healthy individual should experience <strong>dream recall</strong>. If you cannot recall <strong>"good dreams”</strong>, and you only remember <strong>nightmares</strong> (You wake fearful, worried, upset, death thoughts), you may be deficient in Vitamin B6. Have you ever had constant, terrifying nightmares? I remember only too vividly, waking up in the middle of the night drenched in sweat, as I struggled to get away from some ominous fate. Looking back on those episodes, nightmares can be caused from eating too much meat (concentrated in fat and cooked protein) and dairy products (high in fat and pasteurized cooked protein).  All of which can deplete enzyme levels and vitamin B6 and B complex.
<p><dd>
A good source of B6 is brown rice, bananas, corn, and carrot juice. Take a supplement of B6 of 100 to 600 milligrams per day until dream recall begins to occur, then taper off the dosage down to 2 to 25 mg per day. According to Carl C. Pfeiffer, Ph.D., MD, in his book <strong><em>Nutrition and Mental Illness</em></strong>, a health practitioner may have you use a maximum of 2,000 mgs. per day until you experience dream recall. If you awaken every two hours during the night with vivid dreams, and remember up to four dreams in the morning you are getting too much B6. If B6 produces numbness of fingers or toes, shift to pyridoxal phosphate B6 at 200 mg. 
<p><dd>
For good mental health avoid being contaminated with copper from birth control pills, drinking water from copper pipes, or any supplement with added copper. Use other forms of birth control such as condoms. Use filtered water, and get additional water from fruits and vegetables. The roots of plants naturally filter the water.  When I'm thirsty, the first thing I eat is a juicy tomato, or grapes.
<p><dd>
What if you have been exposed to any of the above sources of concentrated copper? Check with a doctor to have your copper levels and zinc levels in the urine, blood plasma and hair measured.  If copper is found to be elevated and zinc low, take the antidote of zinc gluconate, 15 mg to 30 mg a day. Also you should consume more tropical fruits like mangos and pineapples for a source of manganese. Zinc can cause an imbalance in manganese, this is why you need to add manganese when taking zinc supplements. Manganese gluconate of 10 to 50 mg a day will prevent any problems.
<p><dd>
Some conditions that have been helped by treating high copper levels, added zinc and manganese include:
<p><dd>
Paranoia, disperceptions, feelings of persecution, fearful-feelings, Autism, loss of contact with reality, schizophrenia (a misleading Diagnosis or false label), depression, anemia compulsions, hallucinations, impotence, and nervous exhaustion.
<p><dd>
Additional tests your doctor might run include blood and urine histamines levels. Also, check the blood for vitamin B6. You should have your cholesterol level done as part of a lipid panel, a chemistry panel with liver and kidney enzyme levels, and CBC with blood morphology.
<p><dd>
According to Stephen Edelson MD treating <strong>Autistic children</strong> in Atlanta Georgia, over 500,000 children in the USA are <strong>mentally retarded</strong> associated with autism. Yet just forty years ago, autism was very rare, sometimes described as childhood schizophrenia.  Now it is so common that one in 1,000 child born with organic brain damage are exposed to high levels of organic chemicals and heavy metals at birth because the mothers or fathers had toxic levels in their bodies.  Parents at highest risk are people working with chemicals every day at the work-site such as chemists, manufacturers, factory workers, artists, graphic designers, laboratory workers, and the printing industry. Young children or parents can be exposed to household cleaning chemicals, mercury in immunization shots as well as pesticides.  A test using D-Glucaric acid becomes elevated in the presence of toxic organic chemicals in the fatty tissues of the body.  A much higher concentrate stores in the fatty tissue of the brain, nerves, and fat cells of babies, children, and adults.  Over 94% of the children tested by Dr. Edelson had toxic chemical levels and metals in the blood with over 100 times more in there body tissues and fat storage areas.
<p><dd>
If you suspect mental dysfunction, have your children tested for heavy metals such as mercury, lead, tin, aluminum or arsenic in the hair analysis, urine, and blood.  Test for organic chemicals such as trimethylbenzene, methylpentane, xylenes, toluene, chloroform, heptane, trichloroethylene and other dangerous neurotoxins.  Thalidomide, alcohol, and cocaine use are toxic to the undeveloped fetus brain.  The National Institutes of Health tested 55,908 pregnant women and found 14 children who had infantile autism.  All 14 mothers had been exposed to high levels of organic chemicals and metals involving their occupations!   
<p><dd>
A genetic defect found in greater than 90% of the autistic children identified a lack of an enzyme needed by the liver to detoxify and remove toxic foreign chemicals.  Mothers and their children need to be protected prior to and during pregnancy to protect the delicate brain of the fetus from being exposed to common environmental and occupational chemicals such as glues, carpets, plastics, paints, and pastes or face the terrible consequences of severe mental retardation and autism.
<p><dd>
Dr. Edelson has reported up to 80% success rate in helping autistic children to become normal after treatment, if they were younger than 8 years old.  It may take over two years to treat the children and their mothers before the children start to function nearly normal.  I viewed films of autistic children between 4 months and eight years old becoming normal functioning children after two years of receiving treatments at the Edelson Center. 
<p><dd>
Treatments included <strong>daily saunas</strong> for the children at 160 degrees to sweat out the organic chemicals lasting as long as 15 to 45 minutes per session two to four times a day under medical supervision.  <strong>Allergy restrictions</strong> of foods or substances determined by the ALCAT Test to detect enlargements and damage to white blood cells.  <strong>Supplementation</strong> with melatonin, antioxidants and other critical supplements to cross the blood brain barrier to help detoxify these chemicals and toxins.  Vitamin B12 (methylcobalamin) at high dosages of 500 mcg per kg per day may help reduce nerve damage caused by toxic chemicals such as hexane, or mercury.  Support for a <strong>poor digestive tract</strong>, use of L-Glutamine, and treatment for candida overgrowth..  <strong>IV chelation</strong> therapy was also needed by many of the children genetically unable to remove chemicals via the liver or kidneys.  The chelation is most effective in removing toxic heavy metals such as lead, mercury, and arsenic.  You can help your stricken child avoid mental retardation of autism by studying our web site aginghealthy.net and visit the web site <a href="http://www.edelsoncenter.com"><strong>www.edelsoncenter.com</strong></a> or calling 404-841-0088.

There are over 3,000 hidden <strong>chemical additives</strong> in foods.  The average American consumes one pound of food additives per year!  Monosodium glutamate, sugar substitutes, dyes, preservatives like nitrates, emulsifiers, fillers, waxes, tenderizers, texturizers, antibiotics, and antifreezes are added to processed food. Supplements that are not labeled GMP-good manufacturing practices may be dangerously concentrated with chemicals.
<p><dd>
Other sources of toxins may present in ice cream. Ice cream contains Diethyl Glucol, which is also used in anti-freeze and paint removers.  A vanilla substitute, Piperonal, is also used to exterminate lice.  A certain cherry flavoring (Alydehyde C 17) is used in rubber dyes and plastic; pineapple flavoring (Ethyl Acetate) is used to clean textiles, leather and to extract supplements.  There is a nut flavoring (Butradlehyde) used in rubber cement, a banana flavoring (Amyl Acetate) used in paint solvent - the list seems endless.  Why don't they tell you these common food additives are solvents and are used in these products?  It's because the food manufacturers aren't required by law to put the original name on the labels; they can simply say "banana flavoring" instead of its true name: Amyl Acetate.  So, just because these names aren't labeled on your foods, it doesn't mean the foods are healthy for you.  It's best to stick with whole, natural foods.
<p><dd>
We also have to contend with the inevitable environmental pollution.  In studies conducted by Cal-Tech, it was found we have a 500% increase of lead in our bodies, compared with prehistoric man.  It only takes four times that level to reach a toxic level.  We are at a borderline of extinction. That is why there has been a movement toward unleaded gasoline and getting lead out of paint bases and so forth.  These <strong>heavy metals</strong> can build up in our bodies.  According to the medical journal, Lancet, certain tests like hair analysis, can access the amount of toxic metals in the body.  There are certain foods that can help remove these heavy metals.  Foods high in soluble fibers, such as beans, peas, apples, pears, oat bran and corn flakes, seem to stick to heavy metals and reduce their content in the body.  These foods also lower cholesterol, so you should use them as a preventive formula.
<p><dd>
<strong>Biomagnification</strong> is the increased concentration of <strong>chemicals, pesticides and toxins</strong> that results when animals eat grains and vegetables exposed to pesticides, which concentrate 1,000 times in the animal's fat. When you eat the animal, the pesticides and heavy metals like mercury or lead can concentrate in your body not just double, but 1,000 X 1,000 or one million times! The concentration of these potentially deadly chemicals increases the higher you eat on the food chain. Meat, fish and dairy products expose you to the highest concentration of these deadly chemicals. Grains, fruits and vegetables are comparatively safe.
<p><dd>
Small fish and plankton consumed by larger fish like tuna or swordfish, and eventually eaten by humans, have potentially high concentrations of chemicals that are dose related. The higher the dosage, the more dangerous the chemicals become as they concentrate in your body to lethal levels that may induce cancer or liver failure. <strong>Meat, chicken and fish have 10 times more pesticides</strong> than plant foods: fruits, vegetables or grains.
<p><dd>
Drinking the milk of animals (cow or goat) is equally dangerous because of the buildup of harmful substances that end up in the secretions (milk) of the animal. <strong>Dairy products</strong> (milk, cheese, sour cream and eggs) have <strong>5-1/2 times more toxic pesticides</strong> than do plant foods. A woman who eats low or at the origin of the food chain (fruits, vegetables and grains) will be eating lower - fat foods with fewer chemicals, and in turn with fewer chemicals for her baby.  According to the New England Journal of Medicine, March 26, 1981, only 2% of mothers' milk from women eating only grains, beans, fruits and vegetables (no meat) were found to contain significant levels of <strong>DDT and other toxic chemicals</strong>. By contrast, 100% of mothers eating <strong>meat and dairy products</strong> produced breast milk with significant levels of DDT, pesticides and toxic chemicals.
<p><dd>
DDT poison was banned in the US, however, world- wide more DDT is being used today than at any time in the past.  Years ago a chemical company spilled DDT in a lake in Florida.  When the water was measured it was clean, however at the bottom of the lake the microorganisms were contaminated with DDT and the fish, frogs, and alligators lost the ability to reproduce lacking sufficient sperm counts. Humans now have 50% less sperm counts than was present just 30 years ago.  How much more are we going to pollute our environment?  We may not be able to control outside contamination, yet we can control what goes into our bodies via our mouth. And this is the biggest single source of risk when we consume other animals and dairy products.
<p><dd>
Health-conscious people prefer to buy organic fruits and vegetables. Purchasing organic, seedless red and green grapes, potatoes, apples or carrots is worth the extra 10 to 60 cents a pound to avoid chemicals and pesticides. The average person eats at least 4 lb. of food a day, so for a mere $1.40 extra a day we will be supporting those farmers who care about future generations. This may force other farmers to begin farming pesticide free.
<p><dd>
If you do buy non-organic fruits and vegetables, like cabbage or lettuce, then take a moment to peel the outer leaves. Rinse broccoli, cauliflower, nectarines, pears or grapes in water. You may want to soak them briefly with a dash of liquid soap or use one of the vegetable cleaner solutions currently available at health food stores. Peeling non-organic apples may be necessary, since the wax seals the pesticides onto the apples. It's far better to eat the fruits, vegetables and breads as they are, as compared to the fast foods and deadlier TV dinners. Less than 7% of the pesticides we consume come from grains, fruits and vegetables. However, 55% of the pesticides come from meats and 33% come from dairy products.
<p><dd>
<strong>Toothpaste, shampoos, deodorants and cosmetics</strong> can have large amounts of <strong>cancer-causing</strong> agents.  Pharmaceutical and cosmetic companies try to create <strong>synthetic substances</strong> that mimic what natural products are supposed to do.  Natural products are in short supply and it’s cheaper to create synthetics.  Only a few good companies use all natural ingredients in their products and processing to obtain the finished products.  Cosmetics with Isomer, or Chiral compounds discovered by Louis Pasteur, have the same chemical composition for effective skin care.  Our web site aginghealthy.net will give a list of the best products free of chemicals and toxins.  Start using only “clean products” free of toxins for the sake of your health and your loved ones.  
<p><dd>
Be sure the <strong>supplements</strong> you use are meeting GMP standards.  Good Manufacturing Practices means your supplements are prepared, purified, and sterilized without using <strong>toxic chemicals</strong> such as acetone, Ethyl Acetate, Methylene Chloride, Ethylene Oxide, Ethyl Alcohol, and Butyl Alcohol.  Anti-oxidants are supposed to rid your body of free radical damage and toxins however, the popular Pine bark extracts have more toxic residues (1,735 mg per kg of Ethyl Acetate) then they get rid of because of incorrect processes used to extract them.
<p><dd>
<strong>Used only approved GMP Supplements that will help you with detoxification.</strong>  Effective Supplements to remove toxins include: Alfalfa, Bee Pollen, Garlic, Parsley, Capsicum, grape seed extract, Norwegian Kelp, Siberan Ginseng, Una de Gato, False unicorn, black cohosh, blue cohosh, cramp bark, pennyroyal, bayberry bark, ginger root, squaw vine, uva ursi, valerian root, blessed thistle, echinacea root, golden seal, burdock, dandelion, cayenne, chickweed leaf, slippery elm, comfrey, yellow dock, mullein and marshmallow root.
<p><dd>
<strong>Sauna treatments</strong> start with 15 minutes and work up to 30 minutes at 160 degrees.  Some people buy at home sauna to use it 2 to 3 times a day.
<p><dd>
<strong>Water filters, reverse Osmosis</strong>- to clean drinking water and shower head attachments for pure bathing water.  The skin is a major absorber of chemicals from tap water.
<p><dd>
<strong>Cleansing Therapy Baths</strong> can help remove <strong>heavy metal poisoning</strong> from mercury in your silver amalgams, aluminum from cookware and antacids, and lead from gasoline fumes, pesticides and paint.  Submerge your body in hot water with <strong>one cup</strong> of regular name brand <strong>Clorox bleach</strong> to leach out the toxic metals.  When the water cools get out.  Let four or more hours pass and shower off your body to remove any residue clinging to your body.  A fiber rich diet with vegetable and fruit helps to leach out toxic chemicals from your intestines and tissues.
<p><dd>
On the alternate day bath with two pounds of <strong>Baking soda</strong> dissolved into the tub (don’t mix the baths at the same session) to remove <strong>nuclear waste material</strong> for irradiated cobalt 60 used on supermarket foods.  Sip a glass of warm water with ½ teaspoon of baking soda.  Stay in the tub about 30 minutes until the water cools.  Get out and shower residue off four or more hours later in the day or night.  
<p><dd>
On the third day combine one pound of <strong>Rock or sea salt</strong> and one pound of <strong>baking soda</strong> in a hot tub and remain in until in cools. Sip warm water with 1/2 teaspoon of rock salt and baking soda. Later in the day Shower off the residue from <strong>X-rays</strong> (airports, doctor’s office) or <strong>radiation</strong> from living near <strong>nuclear plants</strong>, or food from <strong>nuclear test site in South Pacific Islands or Nevada.</strong>

<strong><div align="center"><font size="+1">Allergies</font></div></strong>
<p><dd>
Allergens are the substances that cause allergic reactions.  They can be caused by foods, beverages, chemicals, and by particles in the air.  Allergies may be caused by one of the following reasons.
<p><dd>
We should be fed only mother's breast milk at birth and up until the first nine months of life.  However, many mothers mistakenly think their baby isn't etting enough nutrients. Because of her love and concern for her baby, she begins introducing several foods from the table to her baby.  You may have often heard mothers proudly commenting on how soon her baby could eat eggs, meat, cheese, or cereal. 
<p><dd>
This premature introduction of foods is nearly impossible for the baby’s newly formed intestinal tract to digest properly.  Large undigested protein, fat and carbohydrate molecules from these specific foods find their way into the baby's blood stream.  The babies’ immune system produces special proteins called antibodies to destroy the "invader" food particles and foreign bodies.  By mistake, the baby's immune system may become conditioned to always react adversely to the consumption of those same foods later in life.  We call these episodes "allergic reactions" to foods.  This type of allergy problem may have been avoidable if infant formula or other unnatural foods were not introduced so early as a substitute for mothers' milk.  
<p><dd>
Mothers can cut their babies allergy problems by avoiding allergy-triggering foods while pregnant and breast-feeding.  A study reported in The Lancet states that a mother may cut a babies' chances of developing allergies in half during the first year of life.  By reducing contact with foods that are likely to cause allergies such as dairy products, secondhand tobacco smoke and dust mites, the allergy risk can be substantially lowered.  Long term studies are needed to determine whether avoidance merely delays rather than prevents allergies.
<p><dd>
In the study of 120 mothers and their babies, half the mothers ate no fish, milk, eggs or nuts during pregnancy.  The mothers also avoided feeding their infants dairy, eggs, wheat or oranges during the first year.  Instead, the babies received a hypoallergenic formula.  This group also had their homes treated for dust mites.  The other group took no precautions.  After one year the researchers found the 40% of infants in families with no intervention had allergy problems as opposed to 13% of the prevention group.  Infants in families with no intervention were more likely to have asthma or eczema.  In both groups, infants who had one parent who smoked were four times more likely to have allergies - if two parents smoked, the incidence was almost five times higher.  
<p><dd>
Allergies also can develop because of genetics.  In social regions of the world, people have become allergic to certain foods and their offspring will always be allergic to these foods or chemicals.
<p><dd>
Allergies are not to be confused with intolerance to certain foods, such as "lactose intolerance."  A person may have a problem digesting the lactose sugar in milk.  When a person has an intolerance to lactose they may have trouble digesting the complex lactose sugars.  The undigested lactose sugars may rot in the stomach, sour and cause extreme gas, pain and discomfort in the digestive tract.  
<p><dd>
<strong>Allergies</strong> are different from <strong>intolerances</strong> because the food is actually attacked by your own immune system.  For example, if you experience respiratory cold like symptoms, the white blood cells release powerful substances called enzymes and histamines to ward off or destroy the invader.  These histamines will cause your nose to "run" and your eyes to "water" as a defense system.  Normally, the invader would be a bacteria or virus and it would be destroyed by your white blood cells.  In the case of allergies, your body makes a mistake, and gets set for battle against substances normally in the environment such as pollens, molds, foods and chemicals.
<p><dd>
Some people with depressed serotonin levels resort to drugs to feel better.  Individuals using Prozac, a drug similar to cocaine’s action has an ability to restore declining serotonin levels.  Other people have too high of serotonin levels and struggle with addictive behaviors.  Serotonin and tryptophan are the energy managers of the body.  We need additional water and water rich fruits and vegetables to maintain sufficient amounts of serotonin.  Serotonin regulates the water outside of the cells.  People with high histamine levels have higher sodium levels, because the body is retaining sodium to conserve water during states of dehydration.  The easy solution to solve high histamine and greater tendencies towards allergies is to consume more water and salt.  Histamine is a very important substance that is an anti-viral, anti-fungal, anti-bacterial defense system.  Histamines handle drought conditions to manage water levels during times of dehydration.  Dehydration produces a lot of histamines.  By the time you are thirsty, you are severely dehydrated.  In most cases people  and chronically dehydrated from years of lack of sufficient water and from drinking dehydrating beverages like coffee and soda.  You must constantly anticipate your water needs to avoid the consquences of dehydration.  To reduce allergic reactions, it is most critical to increase your water intake (one to two glases of water every three hours) along with water rich fruits and vegetables while avoiding dehydrating foods or drink.  
<p><dd>
Water (eight to ten 8 oz. glasses a day) and a little bit of salt (2 to 4 grams or ½ teaspoon) is one of the most important natural anti-histamines.  You can reduce your allergic symptoms simply be restoring the balance of water and salt inside and outside your cells of your body.  The small amount of salt added to your water or food is used by the body to hold some water outside the cells to create a balance of water retained inside the cells.  Be careful of processed  foods in cans and packaged food tends to contain too much salt.  Also don’t avoid salt all together because we need just a very little amount every day (1/2 to ¾ tsp of salt).  Our blood serum is very much like the balance of water and salt in the ocean.  There is a delicate balance of fluid from water and salt that must be maintained in our blood and in all the cells of our body.  
<p><dd>
There are over 20 enzymes inside our white blood cells that are released during delayed and allergic reactions.  The symptoms delayed allergic reactions and of dehydration (dehydration aggravates allergic reactions) include fatigue, pain, itchiness, allergic shiners (dark circles under the eyes), edema (swelling of hands, face, or stomach) and mental disorders.  Some of the reasons delayed food allergies get worse as we get older is because of repetitious eating of the same foods day after day.  Eating foods that are not natural for humans (such as dairy products, cereal grains, coffee), decline in hormones (growth hormone), and an increase in stress hormones.  All of these conditions tend to cause more dehydration and lack of sufficient water to carry on bodily functions of life.  We must add back fruits, vegetables and water, while avoid delayed allergy producing foods and deyhdrating beverages and food.

Sometimes a person may be allergic to a particular mold that routinely grows on certain foods.  This person may not be allergic to the food, but after only 24 hours, the food; such as bread, fermented items such as wine, soy sauce or cheese may grow mold on it and cause a reaction. 
<p><dd>
To avoid mold type reactions you can store your food properly by immediately freezing those foods you don't finish eating at your last meal. Also, purchasing smaller quantities of fresh food, and eating them fresh, can help people who are found to be allergic to molds. 
<p><dd>
It is often very difficult to find out which foods you are allergic to because most food allergy reactions are the <strong>delayed type</strong>.  A delayed reaction to a food or substance could show up hours or days later. The best way to find out what your allergic to is to find an accurate blood test which uses a persons own white blood cells.  The <strong>Prime Test</strong>® for delayed food allergies reveals several different types of delayed allergic reactions, including IgG, immune complexes and white blood cell destruction.  The Prime Test examines up to 220 foods and chemicals from a small blood sample.  This test enables a doctor to help their patients improve their health by removing the underlying cause of their symptoms.  Special slides with microscopic amounts of different foods and chemicals are examined under the microscope after a person’s white blood cells are added to the slides.  If the white blood cells break down and die, a food or chemical has been discovered that needs to be avoided.  Sometimes you can avoid the food for a while to allow it to clear from your system, and then eat them occasionally to avoid a return of symptoms.  Identifying delayed reactions to foods can help you to develop a personalized plan to free yourself of the stress and fatigue caused from allergies.  For more information about this test, check our web site www.aginghealthy.net or call us at 888-517-7421 and leave us a message with your phone and address if you would like information about Advanced Health Center delayed allergic testing. Mark Lovendale wrote a book titled <em>Quality Longevity</em> focusing on overcoming delayed allergies.

The <strong>ALCAT Test</strong> provided by AMTL Lab in Hollywood, Florida (see <a href="http://www.aginghealthy.net"><strong>www.aginghealthy.net</strong></a>) has gained respect from the medical community using white blood cells and computers to measure delayed food reactions.  They have done well-designed double blind studies with repeatable results.  Computers measure the changes or enlargements of the white blood cells after being exposed to foods and common chemicals.  Although this test may not be as accurate for detecting foods and chemicals your allergic to as the Prime Test, it can be a good starting point.

<strong>RAST allergy test</strong> is another kind of blood test used to detect immediate reactions or acute allergies for IGE.  It is best used for detecting “obvious” reactions to molds, pollens, and dust.  Many other allergy tests such as <strong>skin scratch</strong> tests or prick test are less reliable or reproducible, and unable to detect delayed allergic reactions.  IgE acute reactions to foods generally don’t need to be tested for by blood or skin test because they show up clearly right after the food is eaten.
<p><dd>
We suggest you focus on foods first, since you have a greater degree of control over foods than pollens or dust in the air.  By learning to avoid those foods that you are allergic to, it will reduce the load on your immune system.  Now your immune system will only have to deal with environmental factors and infection making it more effective in fighting serious diseases. Rotate those foods (especially grains) you can eat so your body does not develop delayed allergic reactions.  Eat a variety of foods every week.  Avoid eating the same food every day.
<p><dd>
This will strengthen your immune system.  You will get sick much less often.  In past occasions when you thought you had the flu, you may have been actually having a delayed allergic reaction to certain foods.  This problem could have been lessened or avoided with proper understanding of foods that commonly cause adverse reactions.
<p><dd>
You may be allergic to environmental factors beyond your control such as pollens, house dust or chemicals.  Try eating foods free of allergy producing properties and you will be amazed at how much better you will feel.  The elimination diet is a trial and error process described at the end of this chapter to help you feel better and to help you to identify any allergies. 
<p><dd>
If you are allergic to a certain food, rotating it, or eating the food on alternating week, will not stop your body from having a reaction to that particular food.  Rotation diets only lessen the discomfort, because you are eating the offending food less often.  To be cured you must avoid the foods that produce an allergic.  The following is a list of typical reactions caused by delayed food and chemical allergies.
<ul>
<li><strong>Weight Gain:</strong> If you consume foods you are allergic to it can increase certain hormones including serotonin that can cause you to feel excessively hungry, stimulate overeating, and weight gain.  Also allegic producing foods or chemicals cause fluid retention and weight gain.
<li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> changes in children and adults include irritability, fatigue, restlessness, hyperactivity, muscle pain, mental depression, or bedwetting.
<li><strong>Blood:</strong> Allergic reactions can cause low white blood cell count, abnormal blood clotting, low platelet count, iron-deficiency anemia, low levels of serum albumin and globulin proteins resulting in premature aging. 
<li><strong>Gastrointestinal:</strong> Allergies lead to canker sores in the mouth, stomach cramps, vomiting, colic, abdominal distention, bloody stools, intestinal obstruction, diarrhea, constipation, colitis, loss of appetite, growth retardation, painful defecation, irritation of tongue, lips and mouth.
<li><strong>Respiratory:</strong> Allergies are a major cause of chronic cough, sinusitis, asthma, runny nose, nasal stuffiness, tonsil and adenoid enlargement, hoarseness and middle ear trouble.
<li><strong>Skin:</strong> Allergies erupt into eczema, seborrhea, hives, hair loss, rashes, and atopic dermatitis.
<li><strong>Immune Complex Disease</strong>: caused by allergies include rheumatoid arthritis, lupus erythematosus, Henoch-Schonlein purpura, polymyositis, scleroderma vasculitis, periarteritis nodosa, milk-induced intestinal bleeding in infants or adults, gastroenteropathy, nephritic syndrome, pulmonary hemosiderosis, Kidney problems-glomerulonephritis.
</ul>
<p><dd>
Other problems due to Allergies include: arrhythmia’s of the heart, eye inflammation (conjunctivitis), generalized headaches, migraine headaches, sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS, crib death).
<p><dd>
Because dairy products contain more than twenty-five different proteins that are difficult to digest, they are the leading cause of allergic reactions.  Most of the gastro-intestinal, respiratory, skin, behavioral and blood reactions listed above can be symptomatic of dairy related allergies.  The incidence of <strong>Crib death</strong> is higher when the mother or child is consuming dairy products.  Dairy products have also been implicated in the development of a cancer of the immune system called Hodgkin's disease.
<p><dd>
If you are experiencing headaches, hyperactivity or fatigue, it could be caused by dairy products or wheat.  A low fat, water rich diet and slow aerobic exercise will usually solve most Americans’ number-one complaint; fatigue.  If you are still chronically tired after you reach your ideal weight and you are exercising daily, then look for another cause such as food and chemical allergies.  (Try this experiment - stay off all dairy products and or wheat for six weeks, then after this period, drink big glasses of nonfat milk and or consume wheat for several days and see how you feel).   If you go back on dairy products and wheat, in time your symptom may comeback.  
<p><dd>
Colic is another problem caused by the allergic reaction to dairy products.  When a baby boy was constantly crying, the mother asked my opinion.  The mother had already made a considerable change in her diet, switching from whole milk to non-fat milk, etc.  I suggested she stop consuming dairy products altogether.  She was not too happy with my suggestion, because she was breast feeding her child and not giving him any cows milk.  She thought I was crazy!  However, when the mother eats dairy products, the cows milk particles pass into her breast milk and into the baby's intestine and their blood.  The cow’s milk particles cause an allergic reaction that gives the baby stomach cramps, causing persistent fussing and crying.  I referred them to see Dr. Fleiss, a top pediatrician to get his advice.  Dr. Fleiss is a professor at U.S.C medical school and is currently in private practice.  He examined her and the child and told her to go off of all dairy products.  The colic went away and the baby was fine!
<p><dd>
Nursing or pregnant mothers who avoid allergy triggering foods (dairy milk, eggs, cheese, fish, nuts) may cut their babies risk of developing allergies by half according to a study from the June 19, 1992 Lancet.  The babies were raised with significantly less asthma or eczema if the mothers followed an allergy free diet.  Severe to mild allergies affects many races as they get older.  This is only with cow or goat's milk; human milk would not cause a reaction.  Unfortunately, human milk is not available at the store.  However, even infants have been allergic to mother's milk if the mother is drinking cow's milk, which seems to pass on to the baby.  The mother must stop drinking milk, according to Dr. Lendon Smith, pediatrician, and Dr. Paul Fliess, authorities on breast feeding.
<p><dd>
<strong>Bedwetting</strong> is another problem with children.  In some children the allergy inflames the bladder, it enlarges and becomes insensitive to the feeling of fullness and this causes the frequent bedwetting.  There are other causes of bedwetting associated with issues such as deep sleep patterns etc., however you can simply discover if the problem stems from allergies by having your child tested for delayed allergies or trying an elimination diet. 
<p><dd>
Dairy products are a leading cause of <strong>iron deficiency</strong>.  Some people are so severely allergic to dairy products that when milk, yogurt, or cheese reach their intestinal tract, the intestines start bleeding without the person knowing it.  It may change the color of the stool only slightly.  There is a constant loss of blood, to the point where they become anemic.  Many women have been taking iron pills all their life, but cannot stop the anemia problem.  People go off dairy products, the blood loss in the intestine stops and they can then absorb enough iron from diet and or supplements to restore the health of the red blood cells.   
<p><dd>
<strong>Asthma</strong> is a severe breathing disorder that may be caused by acute and delayed allergic reactions. It is a condition of chronic dehydration.  Water intake must be increased to two to three quarts (liters) a day with a pinch of sea salt (1/4 tsp. per quart).  It is clear that dehydration is worsened from coffee, tea, soda pop and alcohol.  You can not count these in your fluid intake.  Only blended whole fruits and vegetables add beneficial amounts of pure water.  Many of our patients with allergies to dairy, eggs, wheat, etc., go off these foods and their breathing clears up.  It doesn’t work 100% of the time, but it makes such a difference that many patients improved to the point of being essentially normal.
<p><dd>
A strange allergic reaction to foods can be muscle pain.  Some people will develop muscle pain, others will get chronic pain from a type of arthritis known as <strong>rheumatoid arthritis</strong>.  A case noted in the medical journal, The Lancet, was of a woman who had a thirteen-year history of rheumatoid arthritis.  She was taken off all dairy products and within four months all the pain and stiffness went away from her joints completely.  She then had one challenge test.  The doctor fed her a small amount of milk and cheese and within 24 hours all the pain in her joints came back.  It continued until she was off all the dairy products again.  Many arthritics go off fat and the joints improve as the circulation improves, but many people under estimate the connection with allergies.  
<p><dd>
<strong>Skin problems</strong> including dermatitis, eczema and hives can be allergy related, as can canker sores.  We have had many patients with skin type allergy reactions.  They improve by avoiding such foods as milk, yogurt, eggs, shellfish, dried fruit, nuts, and certain food dyes.  L-Lysine seems to help reduce canker sores because it helps offset the arginine.  Arginine is an amino acids found in nuts and other foods.
<p><dd>
The skin is an excretion organ that tries to remove toxic waste via the pores. The dead white blood cells form pus, acne and pimples to help remove waste out of the body. The immune system also may leave skin lesions as it battles allergens.  Your skin may also improve dramatically as you reduce fats, oils, and sugars.  As you identify what your allergic to, notice how quickly your skin becomes healthier. 
<p><dd>
<strong>Vomiting and bloating</strong> of the stomach are other problems connected with dairy products.  When I was in my teens and early twenties, I suffered from bloating and <strong>diarrhea</strong> every day.  I went to a doctor who prescribed Pepto-Bismol for my problems.  Then I read that bloating and diarrhea could be related to dairy products.  I went off all dairy products and within a week I began to feel much better and after three weeks the bloating went away also.  I no longer looked pregnant!   My face and entire body got very puffy when I bloated. 
<p><dd>
At one point I was drinking nonfat milk.  Nonfat milk is much more concentrated in the milk proteins and the milk sugar than whole milk.  I didn't realize I had an allergy to milk proteins and intolerance to the lactose milk sugar until I did switch from whole milk to the nonfat.  Even after I tried "Lactate" to predigest the milk sugar, I still had a major problem with milk products.
<p><dd>
I thought I was doing a great thing for myself by using nonfat dairy products.  If you have an allergy to dairy products and switch from whole milk products to nonfat items, the allergic reaction may become more pronounced.  Don't blame going to a lower fat diet, you are probably very sensitive to dairy products.  When I was eating dairy products I also felt "senile," disoriented and unable to concentrate.  After going off all dairy products I could think clearly and my memory was restored to a high functional level.  
<p><dd>
I remember one of our patients who was about 70 years old.  His wife had him on a low fat diet and one-day she brought him into our clinic.  He could not even communicate and he looked "out of it."  I reviewed his diet and noticed he was using nonfat dairy products.  I suggested to his wife that they try eliminating all dairy products.  In one month he came back in and I was happy to see the change in him and he was talking up a storm!  His wife was very pleased with the results of this dietary change.  His doctors thought he was senile, but after the change in diet, he regained control of his faculties.  I sometimes wonder about the diagnosis given to our elderly concerning senility.  Don't underestimate the power of nutrition and what it can do for you.
<p><dd>
Another major cause of <strong>senility</strong> stems from cholesterol plaques accumulating in the small capillaries and arteries in the brain.  A zero cholesterol diet might prevent many cases of senility.  Be careful to avoid aluminum from cooking pans, aluminum wrap and underarm spray.  (Read labels - only a few brands are "free" of aluminum chlorhydrate.)
<p><dd>
<strong>Ulcerative of colitis</strong>, a much more severe form of digestive disorder and <strong>Crohns disease</strong> also can be connected to allergies.  If you are having reactions such as pain in the lower abdomen, gas, bloody stools, or constipation alternating with diarrhea, then try an elimination diet and see a doctor.
<p><dd>
I have studied many cases of <strong>infant crib death</strong> reported in the medical journals that implicated the use of formulas that were dairy product based.  Much of the evidence supported the hypothesis that an anaphylactic type of reaction occurred after the inhalation by the baby of the cows milk protein.   The milk was regurgitated from the stomach during sleep and caused the crib death.  Babies frequently regurgitate small quantities of food during sleep and often leave traces on the pillow.  This theory suggests that the inhalation of this material can induce a lethal reaction and that only a small amount in the lungs can cause death.
<p><dd>
To support this hypothesis, an experiment was conducted on guinea pigs.  The animals were lightly anaesthetized to simulate the sleeping child.  Milk was taken from the stomach contents of cases of crib death and many animals died rapidly - they stopped breathing without any sign of struggle.  The pathological findings in these animals resembled those of the babies who die of crib death.       
<p><dd>
In our country women are encouraged to use formula instead of breast feeding by the companies that produce the different formulas.  This isn't too hard to do, since we live in such a fast paced society.  In third world countries, however, the women usually breast-feed because they live a poverty-stricken existence and money for formula would be considered a luxury.  But, in some of these poor countries, they started programs for the mothers to receive formula free for their babies.  The babies would be weaned from the breast milk and start on formula.  Many of these babies started dying suddenly from "no known cause."  Also, many died of diarrhea related symptoms because dehydration would set in after suffering from diarrhea for so long.  
<p><dd>
Crib death is said to be of unknown cause, but I suspect we know the reason this occurs, not in all cases certainly, but in many.
<p><dd>
Cancer of the immune system, <strong>Hodgkin’s disease</strong> has been attributed to dairy related allergies.  The continuous over stimulation of the immune system by dairy proteins may eventually lead to the breakdown of the immune system into this form of cancer.  Consumption of large amounts of chicken has also been linked to this disease.
<p><dd>
Many people try goat's milk because they have heard it is less allergy producing than cow's milk.  This may be true for some people, however, milk from any animal (other than human breast milk), is likely to cause an allergic reaction.  Try using lite- soy milk, rice milk or almond milk.
<p><dd>
Some studies show that fat in the diet is a major culprit in the development of <strong>multiple sclerosis</strong>, according to Roy Swank MD.  Excess fats clump the red blood cells and restrict circulation and oxygen to the nerves.  After 30 or 40 years of eating a high fat diet, it's no wonder multiple sclerosis is higher in the United States than most other countries in the world.  In Norway, in those regions where a high fat diet is consumed, they have a significantly higher rate of multiple sclerosis.
<p><dd>
By comparison, in the coastal regions, a lower fat diet is consumed, and though they are the same "genetic race," the incidence of multiple sclerosis is lower.  The only difference is the fat in the diet.  Dairy products are also suspected in damaging the myelin sheath of the nerves.  It is believed that severe allergic reaction to dairy products or other foods may damage the nerves.  Dairy products and fat should be reduced to help lower the incidence of this disease as well.
<p><dd>
These diseases and allergic reactions from dairy products are compelling reasons to switch to non-dairy products such as lite soy milk, rice milk, or potato milk.  Try the <strong>allergy Elimination diet</strong> and see and feel how much better life becomes for you. 
<p><dd>
For children, the elimination diet starts with brown rice cereal, rice milk, brown rice bread from the health food store (free of milk, wheat, gluten, eggs, soy, or artificial colors).  Give your child a choice of yams, cooked non-citrus fruit like prunes, green and yellow vegetables.  After one or two weeks if the bedwetting stops or other allergic reactions go away, then you know the problem is food related.  Each three days you are to add a new food and monitor for any reactions.  If all goes well, you can add it to the child's list of safe foods.  Those foods that cause a reaction should be recorded in writing and put up on the refrigerator marked in red. The good foods should be put in your child's favorite color.  Add to the good foods list from the Grow Young ans Slim six food group of grains, green vegetables, yellow vegetables, potatoes and tubers, beans and peas, citrus and non-citrus fruit.
<p><dd>
Here is an easy way to do your elimination diet.  Eat the foods that are the least allergy producing for a week and allow your system to clear.  If the symptoms that you were experiencing stop, you know it is probably food related allergies.  Then eat green vegetables, non-citrus foods, yams, and a few other items we would list for you.  After a week add in the first product you suspect is the offending agent - milk.  If you get flu like symptoms, sore throat, cough, skin reactions, or emotional moody swings, eliminate that food from your diet.  Next add wheat, do you get sick?  If not, you probably are not allergic to wheat.  You continue in this way adding in different foods to determine if you get a reaction.  Some foods may cause an immediate reaction (IGE) within hours, other foods may cause a delayed reaction (IGG) one or two days later.  Testing and careful analysis with an expert will help solve the problems associated with allergies. 
<p><dd>



Summary of the key points to follow while on the <strong>elimination diet</strong> to detect allergies:
<ol>
<li value="1">Be sure to <strong>cook all foods</strong> thoroughly, because cooking changes the proteins in foods, making them less likely to cause allergic responses.
<li value="2">Temporarily <strong>stop using all condiments</strong> such as salad dressing, herbs, spices, mustard, vinegar, lemon juice, food with artificial additives, colors, or dyes.  You may use just a sprinkle of salt after cooking (avoid salt if you have high blood pressure, edema, kidney disease, or arthritis).
<li value="3">Under your doctor’s guidance, <strong>stop the use of all medications</strong>.
<li value="4">For one week, eat only the least allergic producing foods and substances such as vegetables and cooked fruit listed below.  This will clear from intestines and bloodstream food allergens.
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>Green vegetables</strong>, cooked such as spinach, asparagus, string beans, celery, artichokes, beet greens, chard, lettuce.
<li><strong>Yellow vegetables</strong> winter squash (cooked) Sweet potatoes, yams (cooked) or <strong>orange vegetables</strong> (cooked) such as summer squash, beets, carrots.
<li>Cooked <strong>non-citrus fruit</strong> such as peaches, prunes, plums, papaya, cherries, cranberries, apricots. 
<li><strong>Water only</strong>, no fruit juices, or soft drinks.
</ul>
<br><p><dd>
After one week of only the above foods, allergic-type reactions should be considerably less.  If you don't notice any change you may not have food allergies.  However, the only way to find out for sure is to introduce one test food into your diet at a time. Try adding each single food eaten in large quantities, several times a day, for two days. For example add brown rice, puffed rice, rice flour, rice milk (plain), brown rice bread (with no additives, no eggs, no dairy, no wheat), rice pasta.or Tapioca (you can make pudding if you cook it with rice milk).  If you have allergic reactions to that food, list it as a food you can't eat.  
<p><dd>
Wait four to seven days, by eating only those foods you are not allergic to, before introducing the next test food.  You can test the fruit, veggies, and starches in the above list by eating them raw, one at a time.  You can build on the list of foods that are safe for you to eat after several weeks of testing. Be sure to test corn, wheat, tomatoes, citrus fruit, strawberries, chocolate, and nuts because they are common causes of allergies of plant origin.  The leading cause of allergies from animal based foods include dairy products, eggs, shellfish, and fish.
<p><dd>
For peak performance and good mental health, avoid all dairy products and use rice milk, or soy milk. Avoid wheat products, barley, rye and oats as much as possible and use the rice or the suggested grains listed above. Gluten is a protein in wheat, barley, rye, and oats and it is very difficult to digest for many people. This may be because the digestive enzymes cannot digest the gluten. The undigested gluten protein leaves an accumulation of toxic material in the intestines. This irritates the lining of the intestinal wall, causing constant indigestion and malabsorption of all nutrients. It is also possible that endorphins found in gluten compete with our body's endorphins (vital brain chemicals involved in mood).
<p><dd>
Whatever the reason, weeks and months may be required before a marked improvement appears after wheat, rye, barley, oats, milk, cheese, and yogurt are removed from the diet.  Reintroduction of these grains and dairy products into the diet usually produce a relapse in days or even hours!  This is why it is important to maintain a strict adherence to the diet and to be aware of the exact ingredients of many foods. 
<p><dd>
<strong>Supplements to help with allergies:</strong>  Alfalfa, Bee Pollen,  Fenu/Thyme, Lobelia extract, Melatonin, Una de Gato, white willow bark, golden seal, cayenne, peppermint leaf, Vitamin C, grape seed extract, passion flower, wild yam, valerian root and L-Glutamine (2 grams – ½ tsp. daily).

<strong><li>The Effects of our Diet on Earth’s Resources</strong>
<p><dd>
Are you aware that the majority of earth's resources are used for a meat and dairy based diet?  Over 80% of all oats and corn grown are eaten by livestock and not by humans!  The tropical rain forests are being cleared to allow these animals to graze.  These forests provide an enormous source of oxygen to the environment and this destruction is causing a "greenhouse effect" over the planet.  This in turn produces an increase in the earth's temperature and the atmosphere.  This may change weather conditions, water and other vital nutrients that our planet needs.  
<p><dd>
It takes an acre of land to grow 30,000 pounds of potatoes, but that same acre can only produce 165 pounds of beef.  Clearly, we can feed a great deal more of the human population if we started eating more potatoes, grains, corn, etc.  It takes ten pounds of grain or soybeans for one pound of beef to be raised.  Here is a shocking fact - it takes over 25,000 gallons of water to produce one pound of meat, but it takes only 25 gallons of water to produce one pound of wheat.  Obviously, if we switched over to eating more sprouted grains, fruits, vegetables, and so on, our water consumption would be much lower and we would have more resources.  
<p><dd>
Our water is being polluted by many different sources, much of it from the dairy and meat industries, which uses 50% of our water supply.  33% of our raw materials, which includes fossil fuels such as oil and gasoline, are in short supply.  It is estimated that at our current rate of consumption we only have about 40 year supply left.  However, if we shift over to a complex carbohydrate diet and move away from the meat and dairy products, we would have over 260 years of reserves left.  This probably would give us enough time to develop other sources of energy extraction from the sun or other origin.  
<p><dd>
Pigs, cows and fowl produce 20 times the amount of excrement as the human population.  All that waste by-product ends up in our rivers and our oceans causing severe mass pollution.  55% of our pesticide exposure comes from meat, 33% from dairy product and only 7% from plants.  There is a great deal of publicity about grapes and apples sprayed with pesticides, but there is no discussion concerning the high concentration of pesticides in meat and dairy products.  As you can see, our choice of diet can dramatically affect our earth and its' resources.  We must all return to a more natural diet for our own health and the future of our planet.
