One and one half billion prescriptions were written in 1997 or seven prescriptions for every single U.S. citizen.  However, the fascinating fact is that over $6,000,000,000 (billion) was spent on vitamins, minerals, enzymes, herbs, homeopathic preparations, and amino acids.  <em>Newsweek Magazine</em> predicted a phenomenal 20% rate of growth for supplement sales in just the U.S.  One-third of Americans use alternative therapies, spending over 27 billion dollars last year to see complementary medicine practitioners even though their insurance did not cover most of these visits!  This exceeded the 26 billion dollars spent to see traditional doctors.  People realize that a preventative approach to illness and an interest in enhanced vitality, energy level and longevity is possible with the Grow Young and Slim program from Vibrance.

Some enemies to vitamin and mineral nutrition would be: white sugar, white rice, white flour, alcohol, cigarettes, antacids (they deplete various minerals) and baking soda (depletes the B vitamins). <strong>ANEMIA</strong> - It is important to identify the cause of your blood's reduced ability to carry oxygen first, and then find a solution that is best for you. Sometimes allergies to foods like dairy products can cause micro-bleeding in the intestines resulting in a severe case of iron deficiency. The red blood cells will look abnormally small shaped any carry less oxygen.
<p><dd>
Unfortunately, in our society, processed foods slip into our diet, and we abuse addictive substances such as nicotine, caffeine and alcohol. This can deplete our bodies of B vitamins, which can lead to oval shaped or misshapen red blood cells.  Cells that are small or irregular cannot transfer oxygen along the capillary lining properly.  Because of this you will need some kind of supplement to restore the shape of the cells as new cells form every 120 days.  We have found the Grow Young & Slim Plan of supplementation, nutrition and exercise can build up the deficient blood.  Your need may include iron, B-12, folic acid, Vitamin E and Vitamin C, which can best be found in whole natural foods and organic supplements.
<p><dd>
Organic, colloidal minerals are better because they are smaller and have an electrical charge. Inorganic minerals are too large to be used by the human body.  Most people take supplements of inorganic iron, sodium, or potassium from rock or nonliving substances produced by chemical reactions or man-made extractions. Synthetic, man-made vitamin C, Ascorbic Acid, lacks the beneficial properties of organic vitamin C bioflavonoids found in living, natural foods. The Ascorbic Acid is simply the outer-coating surrounding the essential bioflavonoids.
<p><dd>
The organic sodium and potassium in celery are beneficial to our bodies enhancing enzyme activity and detoxification. Yet the sodium and potassium we get in table salt are potentially toxic to our bodies, blood pressure, heart rate, and enzyme activities. The organic iron in beet juice, green vegetables, and apples (there is more iron in the tart apple varieties like Granny Smith as compared to sweet red delicious) enhances red blood cell development. Yet the inorganic iron (ferrous sulfate) in supplement pills destroys hemoglobin and is potentially toxic to the liver (inorganic iron overload from pans or pills can cause death).
<p><dd>
The “best supplement line” we recommend come from <strong>whole plant foods and herbs</strong> manufactured GMP-Good Manufacturing Practices using concentrated plants, raw vegetables, carrots, broccoli, grains and fruits. Capsules prepared without being heated are best. This preserves the enzymes, vitamins and minerals.
<p><dd>
Food and supplements derived from organic food is the best source to meet your nutritional needs for vitamins, minerals and enzymes.  Only 100 vitamins, minerals and nutrients have been discovered at this time, and the possibility remains several more will be found.  Your best chance of obtaining the nutrition you need would be from whole natural foods like vegetables, fruits, grains, beans and sprouted seeds.  
<br><br><br><dd><li><strong>Live raw food rich in Enzymes, Antioxidants, Phytochemicals</strong></li> 
<p><dd>
A majority of your food intake must be fruits and vegetables for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks. This will provide the purest source of fresh organic water, minerals, vitamins, fiber, and enzymes.  You must consume over 10 servings of vegetables, sprouted grains, sprouted beans, sprouted seeds, and fruit a day as if your life depends on it!  The quality of your health does depend on this simple water rich, nutrient rich diet. Within nine days you will feel the energy and power.  After only three to six months you look young and slim again.
<p><dd>
Don Tolman said that humans are electrical beings and need electricity or micro-electric current to be healthy.  Micro-electric force (electrocity) gives energy to vitalize all the cells of our bodies.  The air we breathe followed by the pure water we drink and the final source of life energy comes from fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, and grains.  If you put a nut into the ground it will grow a huge tree because of its life force.  Electric life force can be measured in live, raw food when a zinc copper anode is plugged into a digital clock. Bananas or apples  will run the clock for two weeks, an orange gives 30 days of electric energy, and a lemon can provide electricity to the clock for over 6 months.  Consuming food electrically alive keeps us healthy, yet eating cooked, baked, processed sugars and fats leaves us devoid of “electric” energy.  
<p><dd>
The processed food may taste good initially and your body makes you feel a rush to deal with the dead food, however if the food is electrically dead and you plug a transmitting wire into cooked, dead food there is no longer any electricity.  In the US, the top selling foods or products include coke, candy and cigarettes.  These foods make you feel drained and fatigued.  
<p><dd>
Ancient cultures like the Greeks studied the body and believed in quality food. “The Doctrine of Signatures” lost due to book burning, suggested foods have a sign of nature or signature pattern.  A walnut looks like a brain.  Walnut has Omega 3 and Omega 5 fatty acids and precursors with the ability to cross the blood brain barrier with it’s own chemistry converts this food into at least 50 or 60 neurotransmitters and increase human intelligence as well as benefiting offspring, as confirmed by Baylor University.  
<p><dd>
Walking 45 minutes three times a week,  eating water rich foods fruits, vegetables, sprouted seeds, nuts, whole grains gives the body a strong immune system, and powerful body.  The sunshine is healthy for our bodies unless we don’t eat these foods rich in antioxidants, enzymes and phytochemicals to protect us from cancer and free radical damage.
<p><dd>
We now offer tasty, nutritious snacks rich in fiber and live nutrients called <strong>Pulse</strong>.  We also have a food line with <strong>First Harvest</strong> complete with <strong>soups and entrees</strong>, free of additives, toxins, and fatty animal products.  You can order these snacks for you, your relatives and your whole family on our web site.  For a rich supply of enzymes, organic vitamins, and minerals, add to your lunch, dinner, or late meals a big bowl of raw vegetables with fat-free dressing. Check the web site <strong>www.aginghealthy.net</strong> for a source of <strong>Organic produce</strong> that can be delivered direct to your home for a fee less than if you had bought the grocery’s yourself.  This is produce free of all pesticides and herbicides.  You can order box of over 25 pounds of organic fruit and vegetables direct from the growers within three to four days of picking.  
<p><dd>
Have sprouted sesame seeds, sprouted sunflower seeds, sprouted garbanzo beans, sprouted peas, sprouted bean mix, tomatoes, raw celery, carrots, broccoli, etc.  We need a constant supply of fresh foods to get enough enzymes and antioxidants.
<p><dd>
<strong>ANTIOXIDANTS</strong> such as Proanthocyanidins found in grapes are several times more effective than vitamin E and Vitamin C in protecting the body from the effects of free radicals.  Increasing the intake of these antioxidants result in increased support of the immune system, assistance in collagen development and combating the aging of skin.  Italian red grape seed contain a rich source of “Proanthocyanidins”.  Whole fruit and vegetable herbal supplements are now available which contain citrus bioflavonoids, like quecitin, hesperidin, and rutin.  The Peruvian herb Cat’s Claw is another rich source of antioxidants and immune system booster.  Oligomeric Proanthocyanidins (OPC) are another powerful antioxidant.
<p><dd>
Athletes, sales people, children, housewives, and senior citizens can reach their peak potential and enjoy life more fully by eating more raw, sprouted, uncooked food, enzymes, herbs, hormones and exercising. The Peak performance plan requires a degree of discipline, commonly found in high achievers. Many people choose the immediate gratification of eating sweets and fats (short-term goals of taste). Successful people have experienced the sweet rewards of security and happiness that comes with ideal health.
<p><dd>
Successful people choose more healthful food selections and exercise to reach their long-term goals. They will bypass the temporary pleasure of sweets and select the foods necessary for performance at peak levels. Feeling good and looking great is a powerful motivation for health conscious people, isn't it?
<br><br><br><dd><li><strong>Key dietary principles to follow for peak performance</strong></li> 
<p><dd>
Consume foods rich in fiber and water, unprocessed, uncooked complex carbohydrates in the raw state. Raw foods, such as fruit, vegetables, sprouted grains, sprouted legumes, and sprouted seeds are rich in digestive enzymes. The moment you heat the food by any method (lightly steaming, microwave oven, or stove) you destroy all the digestive enzymes in the food.  Whole foods are rich in phytochemicals.
<p><dd>
<strong>PHYTOCHEMICALS</strong> are naturally occuring chemicals in plants.  Researchers have discovered over 103,000 phytochemicals.  Some phytochemicals are anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antiviral, and serve as an antioxidant able to capture free radicals and prevent them from damaging DNA.  These protective phytochemicals appear to prevent the promotion of the carcinogenic process in two ways.  First by acting as antioxidants that detoxify and block carcinogenic agents from reaching and penetrating cell bodies, and secondly, by increasing production and activity of enzymes that can suppress the expression of malignant changes in cells that have already been exposed and damaged by carcinogens.  This may help reduce the incidence of breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers.
<p><dd>
Other health benefits of phytochemicals include lowering cholesterol, detoxifying the liver, clearing-up bronchitis and nasal congestion, alleviating pain, healing stomach ulcers and stopping cramps.  Natural chemicals in plants can lower the number of histamines in the blood, which in turn reduces allergic reactions. 
<p><dd>
Supplements are available that contain components of whole, organic vegetable and fruit. The organic vegetables and fruit are harvested at the peak of maturity, when they are full of all the rich enzymes, minerals and phytochemicals.  You should be able to break open a capsule and smell fresh fruit and vegetables.  They can contain fresh spinach, lettuce, radish, carrot, beet, cabbage, celery, garlic, parsley, onion, nopal, broccoli, tomato, or apple, guava, grape, pear, watermelon, orange, pineapple, noni, peach, papaya and mango.  Just two capsules have been estimated to contain the nutrients of one eight-ounce glass of raw, fresh-squeezed juice.
<p><dd>
Twenty-five percent of modern prescription drugs are artificial imitations of phytochemicals from plants.  For example, the drug Taxol is an extract from the yew tree, used to treat ovarian cancer.  This single drug will gross drug companies one billion dollars by the year 2000.
<br><br><br><dd><li><strong>Live Enzymes-the life force</strong></li> 
<p><dd>
<strong>ENZYMES</strong> are essential to all of life’s processes.  We have over 1,300 types of enzymes used in every bodily process. We have enzymes in every cell of our body; in our lungs, arteries, brain, and muscles to produce rapid chemical reactions so we can breathe, move, and even, think! The ability to think requires several chemical reactions initiated by enzymes. The only difference between life and death of a cell, tissue, or system is the presence of enzymes. Enzymes provide the actual God given spark of life, the vital living force within each of us. Enzymes are biologically active proteins that we are born with. We have a finite, limited supply of enzymes and when we run out or become too low in enzymes we become ill or die.
<p><dd>
The same process of life or death occurs in all other animals and plants. The genetic clock is present in all animals, influenced by hormone levels, enzymes, and a coded gene for life and death. Death occurs after the gene sends a hormone signal to stop enzyme activity. To extend life to our full genetic capability, we must preserve and protect our enzymes.
<p><dd>
If you deplete your enzyme supply you may weaken your immune system (increasing the risk of disease) and create malfunctions of other bodily systems such as your nervous system, respiratory, musculature, and skeletal systems.  This can shorten your life span by as much as twenty years, according to Dr. Edward Howell.
<p><dd>
There are three ways to deplete our bodies supply of natural enzymes.  One way to deplete our enzyme supply is by eating processed sugars, fats, and proteins.  Sugars, fats, and proteins completely lack enzymes.  They require excessive amounts of enzymes from the pancreas, stomach, and liver to complete digestion.  
<p><dd>
The second way to deplete our supply of enzymes is to eat too many cooked foods.  The mildest form of heating food (over 118 degrees F) destroys all enzymes in the food.  Lightly steamed, stir-fried, microwave or stove cooked destroy enzymes.  A temperature that would be uncomfortable to the skin on your hand will destroy enzymes.  Pasteurization is carried out at 145 degrees F. Water boils at 212 degrees F.  Most cooking is carried out at 300 degrees F. or hotter!
<p><dd>
The last way to deplete our enzymes is by consuming raw seeds, or raw nuts that have not been sprouted.  Raw food that has not been sprouted contains enzyme inhibitors.  Avoid enzyme inhibitors in raw foods (raw seeds, raw nuts, raw grains, or raw legumes), because they destroy your bodies limited supply of enzymes.  Chickens and rats fed raw soybeans not sprouted or cooked become sickened and fail to grow.  If you do eat any of these foods, be sure to sprout them.  Sprouting the raw seed gets rid of enzyme inhibitors.  Remember legumes (beans) and grains are actually seeds before they are sprouted. 
<p><dd>
Another way to get rid of enzyme inhibitors in seeds is to cook the seeds.  This is the only condition that we should cook any food.  Nature provides enzyme inhibitors in seeds, nuts, grains, and legumes to prevent premature growth until being planted in a proper place. Seeds thousands of years old found in pyramids still contain enzyme inhibitors. These enzyme inhibitors serve a vital role in preserving the plant species. Seeds that are extremely ancient will sprout and grow within twenty-four hours after being planted in moist soil. The water soaks into the seeds, nuts, legumes, or grains and completely deactivates the enzyme inhibitors within twenty-four hours.
<p><dd>
Add <strong>digestive enzymes</strong> from a plant source supplement sprinkled from the capsule into your food whenever you eat cooked foods. This will decrease the loss of your limited supply of enzymes. Get an enzyme supplement that contains amylase (digests starch), protease (digest's protein), lipase (digests fat), sucrase and maltase (digest sugar). Open the capsule and sprinkle it on the cooked foods you eat. Sprinkling enzymes onto the food will allow the digestive process to begin immediately in the mouth and stomach. The addition of these supplements will help to preserve your enzymes. Be sure to select the capsules without bile. Bile is foul tasting. You should swallow and not break open capsules with bile.
<br><br><br><dd><li><strong>Sprouting</strong></li> 
<p><dd>
Start sprouting seeds, beans, peas, wheat, sunflower seeds, alfalfa seeds, lentils and chickpeas.  Sprouting helps reduce the fat content of the seeds.  It also enhances the protein and enzyme quality of the food so it is fresh and alive.  Live food may include certain necessary nutrients we have yet to under­stand fully.
<p><dd>
<strong>Sprouting</strong> is simple - place a teaspoon up to a quarter cup of seeds into a glass jar.  It's best to use glass instead of plastic because the light coming through the glass affects the growth beneficially.  A wire screen or cheesecloth cover works well.  Add water and let the seeds soak overnight.  Pour off the water the next day.  Then, rinse the seeds with fresh water once or twice a day, perhaps in the morning and again at night.  Leave the jar at a 45-degree angle after you pour out the water.  Keep it in a dark area or in indirect light, since the sprouts grow best in this situation.  Sprouts are ready to eat by the fourth day.  Usually you can start a new jar the first day, start another one the next and so on, for a constant supply of fresh sprouts.  They're great for stuffing in sandwiches and salads.  Sprouting can increase vitamin and mineral content of the food from fifty to nearly two thousand percent, especially for many B complex vitamins and vitamin C.
<p><dd>
After three days, the sprouts are now little plants fully concentrated in beneficial enzymes.  If you don’t have time to sprout, you can find packages of sprouts in the produce section of your local grocery store. These digestive enzymes inside vegetables, fruits, sprouted wheat berries, or bean sprouts help our bodies during digestion. Without these plant enzymes, our bodies must draw on our own limited supply of enzymes to digest the food. Also, our body will convert some metabolic enzymes to be used as digestive enzymes. Eating cooked food can dangerously deplete our vital metabolic enzymes.  
<p><dd>
Every time we eat junk food, cooked, processed, without enzymes, we deplete more of our storage of enzymes. The normal process of digestion uses up some of our digestive enzymes (lipase, protease, and amylase) in the mouth, stomach, and intestines. We rapidly deplete our storage of enzymes by eating highly processed sugars and fats. Still, the average American consumes over 130 pounds of sugar per year from soda pop, candy, and packaged foods. We consume more than 100 pounds of excess fat and concentrated protein from cheese, meat, and oils.
<p><dd>
It is no wonder that our body, designed to live over 120 years of life, barely makes it through 70 or 80 years of life. Animals fed cooked meat, seeds not sprouted, and processed foods (fatty or sugary) die prematurely. The same species of animal in captivity fed raw meat, or raw organic vegetables, and sprouts live a much longer life.
<p><dd>
If you choose to eat cooked food, you should eat mostly whole, natural vegetarian food. The best grains to use in the cooked form would include: rice, rice pasta, rice cereals, rice milk (Rice Dream) etc. Rice grains are best since they are the least allergic producing grains for most people. 
<p><dd>
Other good grains low in allergy properties would include kamut, spelt, or corn grains. These grains are less allergic producing then gluten containing grains so try them and monitor how you feel. Spelt, spelt bread, spelt pasta, spelt cereals (ancient wheat- free of gluten) are available in the health food store. Corn, corn flakes, corn tortillas are also good choices for an allergy free plan.
<p><dd>
Cooking any of the above grains into bread will cause a complete loss of enzymes in the food, but it will get rid of the enzyme inhibitors. It is best to consume grains of any type after being sprouted. Fermenting of grains or soybeans is another way to get a rich source of enzymes.   Fermented, predigested foods such as tofu (select the low-fat version), miso, and Tempeh are free of enzyme inhibitors, and are rich in good enzymes (if uncooked).
<p><dd>
Creatine is a nutrient stored in the muscle cells (95%).  Creatine and  creatine phosphate are converted into creatinine that comes from muscle metabolism and excreted in the urine.  Creatinine is a measure of muscle mass, muscle damage and of proper kidney function.  The supplement Creatine Monohydrate is made up of three amino acids which your body makes about one gram a day.  Creatine is one of the muscles’ main energy sources.  Bill Phillips an Editor and author of Muscle Media, said <strong>Creatine Monohydrate</strong> is the most effective supplement for gaining size and muscle strenght he has ever used.  By using this supplement, we’re able to “saturate” our muscles with extra creatine, this allows your muscles to refuel after contractions faster making your stronger within five days to a month.  Bill said he gained 9 pounds of muscle tissue mass in ten days and over 20 pounds by the third month.  Since creatine is drug free and natrual to the body, you don’t have to  stop taking it, allowing you to maintain your gains.  When muscles absorb creatine, it brings water into the muscle cells so you have “hydrated” bigger-fuller- and rounder cells.  Muscle cells are made up of over 70% water so when you train with weights or exercise you’ll notice a better pump (more blood to the muscles).  This can be a great supplement for vegetarians who take in less than the one gram of creatine a day (two pounds of steak contain 5 grams of creatine).  Creatine can be taken with or without a meal.  Creatine has helped people with atrophied weak muscles due to neuromuscular diseases.  Some companies have added the leucine metabolite HMB (Beta-Hydroxy  Beta-Methylbutyrate) a potent supplement that can prevent protein breakdown allowing for additional muscle building and toning.
<p><dd>
If you take creatine monohydrate with fruit and vegetable juices (Slim Smoothies), more creatine is shuttled into muscle cells.  Creatine works best in the liquid form, especially for athletes and older people past age 40.  Aging can be associated with lower creatine levels.  When you look in the mirror, you may be surprised how quickly your muscles get bigger.  If you are a non-athlete, and you are interested in toning up your body, use three to five grams (one teaspoon) of creatine a day for a month.  It is best not to exceed 10 to 20 grams of creatine a day beyond a few weeks to maintain proper kidney function and to avoid diarrhea or nausea.  It is best to simply stay at the lower dosages under five grams for a 150 to 180 pound person.  Women can take two to three grams a day to get good results of improved muscle tone.  Also, to get the best results stay on the water rich Grow Young and Slim Plan and add one to two glasses of extra water spaced every two to three hours during the day.  If you stop taking creatine you’ll gradually experience a decline of muscle mass within weeks, yet your gains will return quickly wheb your use just three grams twice a week. 
<p><dd>
Choose <strong>supplements</strong> derived from a variety of whole natural foods.  Look closely upon labeling and ask if they are synthetic or chemically derived.  The <strong>label</strong> must list actual whole food ingredients.  I have only found a few companies that market this top of the line products.  Most supplements depend on dry form tablets or capsules to deliver vital nutrients.  However, when compared to <strong>liquid supplements</strong>, dry tablets and capsules dissolve slower and often contain binders, fillers, yeast, alcohol, corn, soy, dairy and other allergenic substances that must pass through the digestive tract.  Therefore, less than 15% to 25% of the active product is absorbed in dry form.  In liquid form with Liquid Nutrition Technology (an advanced delivery system) it is possible to obtain up to 90% absorption of the oral nutrients taken sublingually (under the tongue) as compared to 10% absorbed in tablet form or 15% in gel caps. This means when you swallow a pill or tablet, less than 10 to 15% of the nutrient actually gets into your blood stream.  The rest is processed and excreted as waste by your gastrointestinal tract. The absorption from Transdermal Patch is 45%, Sublingual is good at 50%, compare this to injection Intra Muscular at 80%.  Now Oral absorption through the mucosa (lining of the mouth) is the preferred choice of medical experts, and provides up to 90% absorption into the blood stream within seconds.
<p><dd>
This superior absorption of the pure powdered substance mixed and suspended in liquid allows particles smaller than 0.3 microns easy absorption pass the oral mucous membrane as reported in the <em>Physicians Desk Reference for Non-Prescription Drugs, 1997, pg. 632; 676</em>. Liquid Supplements use ionic or micro dispersions of ingredients in minute particles.  Plants naturally draw nutrients up through roots like a filter and ionize or allow only microscopic size nutrients.  Supplements with this delivery system are desirable because they are similar to what your body is accustomed to.  These liquid supplements can mix both fat-soluble and water-soluble ingredients in mixed combination without separating, solidifying or becoming cloudy. Within minutes, it is totally dispersed throughout every cell of the body.
<p><dd>
Nutriceuticals, nutrient and herbs that have a proven pharmacological effect on the body, are more effective when delivered directly to the blood by means of inter-oral absorption (alpha-lingual). This is an like sublingual in that it bypass the gastrointestinal tract and its many limitations, with an added absorption surface of the cheeks.  The spray disperses the nutrients to the cheeks and under the tongue.  With Sublingual you are only getting absorption under the tongue.  There is a large added surface area of absorption when you add the cheeks in addition to the tongue.       
<p><dd>
Intra oral absorption is achieved when microsized beads or droplets of an herb or nutrient are taken into the body through the tissue lining of the mouth or nose.  Blood capillaries are extremely close to the surface in these areas in the mouth and you readily absorb the nutrients and herbs into the blood stream.  Just spray twice and hold it in your mouth for 30 seconds before you swallow to allow for maximum absorption.  The flow is from the area of the mouth to the Carotid Artery, to the brain and then on to the major organs nourishing the heart, liver, spleen and kidneys within 22 to 30 seconds. 
<p><dd>
It is important to take supplements in a form that we get the most nutrients absorbed.  The amount of herbal nutritional contents listed on a label doesn’t tell the whole story and can be misleading.  What’s important is not the nutritional content listed on the label…. But what is important is how much of that nutrient or herb is actually absorbed into the cells of the body.
<p><dd>
Remember, this is delivered in a spray alpha-lingual form (getting the entire surface area of the mouth, checks and under the tongue) so those active ingredients get into the blood stream quicker to help you get your desired results quick.  And it is so convenient that it can be carried in a purse or pocket.  All these oral products have absorption of 90% of the nutrients into the body.  There are no pills or gel caps to swallow. They are so convenient to use you can take them anywhere in a purse or pocket. NO water required.  Heart patients now carry their Nitro-glycerin in a spray bottle instead of sub-lingual capsules because the spray is so much faster, more efficient and more convenient.
<p><dd>
Replace all those bottles that lurk in your medicine cabinet today with these simple herbal nutriceutical products.  You won’t have to worry about having too many tempting bottles for young children to get into or having an elderly parent get confused as to which to take.  These products are safe and effective. 
<p><dd>
Some advanced delivery systems carry vitamins and minerals to your cells using <strong>liposomes</strong>, or tiny spheres made of soy lecithin. These multi-layered spheres are 1/50th the diameter of a human hair.  They are able to deliver water soluble and fat-soluble vitamins, minerals, and nutrients.  The liposomes penetrate the mucosal tissue of the mouth or skin and the nutrients are released from billions of liposomes suspended into the bloodstream.  This path bypasses the digestive system longer.  Stomach acids destroy many nutrients, and the nutrients are metabolized in the liver and broken down prematurely.  Liposomes taken orally, or rubbed into the skin increase absorption of supplements, and act longer in the body enhancing bioavailability.   
<p><dd>
Everyone is encouraged to take quality supplements with our program, because virtually everyone on occasion eats processed foods, white flour, sugar or alcohol, or if you live in a polluted environment.  Who doesn't have these situations?  They are very common..  In other words, we know you're going to cheat on occasion.  You might want to take a vitamin-mineral supplement as a preventive formula.  You want a multiple vitamin and mineral that at least meets the RDAs (possibly with more B complex, if you drink alcohol or get more sugar in your diet than you want).  You need to understand safe ranges because too many supplements can be toxic.  I have found the best way to be consistent about taking my supplements is to carry with me a <strong>SUPPLEMENT BOX</strong> or utility container with several compartments for my various vitamins, minerals, enzymes, and herbs. Put your liquid supplements and capsules in a supplement box slipped into your Slim Tote and take it with you during the day.  The top natural bodybuilders like Skip LaCour use a supplement container packed in the Slim tote for convenience and frequent access.
<p><dd>
This guide will serve as a summary to choose your supplements wisely.  There are so many different products and name brands.  I suggest you look at the vitamin and mineral labels dosages to see if your supplement falls into the proper range.  If you find processed foods, extra sugar, white flour or alcohol slipping into your diet, be sure to use the higher end of the ranges for the B complex vitamins.  It is best not to exceed the upper range by too much because toxic side effects can result.  If you haven't used supplements before they may be used as a preventive measure.   While the RDA's listed are a starting point, our safe ranges are based on medical research reports of deficiency from sub-optimal levels and on toxicity from overuse of supplements.  Sublingual, spray, liposome, ionic, and colloidal supplements can be taken in lower dosages (lowest range on the scale) because they are absorbed more efficiently.  The following is a guideline of vitamins and minerals found in foods and their role in good nutrition.

<br><br><br><dd><li><strong>Storing Vitamins, Minerals and nutrients</strong></li> 
<p><dd>
Don't worry if you can't eat the variety of all the foods we have suggested.  By eating a variety and alternating the foods you eat from day to day, you won't have to worry about deficiencies because your body has a storage capacity.  For example, your body can store <strong>potassium</strong> for one to two days, if you aren't getting any new source of potassium.  You can store <strong>calcium</strong> from ten to twenty years, in the bones especially.  Of course, you don't want to deplete your calcium, otherwise later, the penalty will be weakened bones.  Understand, though you don't have to take in a calcium source every day.  The foods we recommend have an ability to provide you with enough calcium..  This is supported by recent studies that show calcium is absorbed just as well by these foods as from other sources.  <strong>Iron</strong> can be stored for four to five months.  <strong>Vitamin A</strong> is stored from one to two years.  <strong>Vitamin B-12</strong> is stored from ten to twenty years (alcohol rapidly depletes storage) and <strong>Vitamin B-3</strong> has storage of two to three months.
<p><dd>
<strong>Sodium</strong> can be stored about two to three days and the problem here is excessive sodium intake.  Your body needs about one to two grams per day.  We get all we need from whole natural foods.  If you eat packaged foods that have sodium added, you'll probably add another one to two grams a day, but this is still a low-sodium diet. On our water rich plan you can add 2 to 4 grams of salt (1/2 teaspoon) to your food, to be in balance.  It is best not to exceed six grams of total sodium per day.  Amounts exceeding ten grams or more can cause you to retain fluid and have other side effects.  Add sodium to your diet when you’re exercising more and during warm temperatures or in dry climates, because you must also increase your water intake.  The body will adapt and adjust itself to conserve sodium and water as necessary, provided you consume at least half your body weight in oz  or 75 to 100 oz per day.
<p><dd>
<strong>Water</strong> can be stored for about four days, and interesting­ly enough, has been recently shown to affect your endurance levels.  It was found if athletes were deprived of water before exercising, they would fatigue much quicker.  If they were allowed to drink extra water before and during the exercise, they lasted the longest.  A third group of athletes, who could only drink water after they started when they were thirsty, lasted an intermediate amount of time.  We have found now it's best to hydrate yourself before exercise.  The rule of thumb is drink about a cup for every 15 minutes of intense exercise activity you anticipate and another cup for every 50 pounds of body weight.  For example, if you weigh 150 pounds, drink three cups for body weight and another two cups if you plan to exercise for thirty minutes.  Those five cups may seem like a large amount, but you can function at your maximum intensity that day during exercise, especially if it's hot outside.  Organic water from fruits and vegetables is best for ideal health.  I blend up 64 oz. of sprouts and vegetables every morning or afternoon to get pure water, enzymes and energy.
<p><dd>
<strong>Carbohydrates</strong> can only be stored for a few hours.  This is important to know because if you don't eat frequent small meals, your blood sugar level may drop and then you have a hypoglycemic reaction.  You'll be fatigued and tired, and then it's hard to get the glucose back to a good range.  It's helpful to eat regular amounts of potatoes, grains, fruits and vegetables to maintain that glucose level.  On our plan you may notice you'll eat more often because you have less fat in your diet.  Fat sits in your stomach and has so many calories it takes away your appetite.  Complex carbohydrates are burned efficiently and cleanly.  Instead of eating three meals, you'll be eating four or five.  It's okay to eat between meals and you should plan each day to do so if you want constant energy.  
<p><dd>
If you were starving in the desert, you can live off the stored <strong>Fat</strong> for at least six to seven weeks.  Some people tell me they store it longer than six or seven weeks and unfortunately a majority of Americans are obese and they wish they didn’t store fat so effectively.
<p><dd>
We store <strong>protein</strong> about six to seven weeks.  We get a good source of protein with all the necessary amino acids from our whole natural foods.  That’s why it’s best to get your protein from fresh food rich in sprouts.  Choose to add protein powders derived from soy, rice or vegetable sprouts. You may add this protein when you are on a low calorie intake centered on vegetables and fruit.
<br><br><br><dd><li><strong>Vitamins and Minerals best source and dosages</strong></li> 
<p><dd>
<strong><u>VITAMIN A</u></strong>  This substance comes from either animal or vegetable sources.  Vitamin A helps you maintain the quality of the mucous membranes and to resist infections. It is essential for bone growth, reproduction, white blood cell development and normal vision.  It has some activity as an antioxidant, yet it works best with beta-carotene and up to 500 carotenoid. The animal source of Vitamin A is somewhat toxic.  A deficiency of Vitamin A, however, has led to an eyeball disease, blindness of the eye and aged skin.  We can avoid both problems, getting too much or too little, simply by relying on the vegetable source of Vitamin A, betacarotene and carotenoids, because you cannot overdose on the vegetable source.
<p><dd>
For example, a cup of carrots has about 16,000 I.U. of Vitamin A, and a cup of sweet potatoes about 20,000 I.U.  The Recommended Daily Allowance (RDA) is only about 5,000 I.U.  Somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 would meet anyone's needs.  If you ate too many carrots, sweet potatoes, mustard greens or squash, eventually your skin may turn a little orange or yellow.  Once your body is ready to convert the betacarotene underneath the skin into Vitamin A, it will; there is no toxicity known with vegetables, so it is perfectly safe to take supplements derived from plant sources.  Yellow and orange-colored vegetables and fruit, such as cantaloupe, contain the good type of Vitamin A (beta-carotene & carotenoids).  Our Grow Young & Slim Plan supplies an excellent amount of Vitamin A, and certainly more than the typical American diet.
<p><dd>
We want you to avoid the animal sources of Vitamin A as much as possible.  Liver, egg yolks and butter fat are high sources of Vitamin A and can be toxic, especially if you take in 100,000 international units (I.U.) per day.  This sources of Vitamin A can build-up in your tissues and lead to side effects.  In a four month period, the animal source was shown to cause nerve, bone and cartilage damage.  It has been known to halt growth in children, lead to blurred vision, headaches, hair loss and to force cholesterol deposits into the tissues.  
<p><dd>
<strong>Vitamin A</strong>  RDA: 5,000 I.U.  If you use animal source supplement is up to 15,000 I.U.  Vegetable source supplements are your best choice.

<strong><u>VITAMIN B-12</u></strong> is part of the B complex family and is necessary to good health.  The B complex vitamins help your body to use carbohydrates, to burn them for energy and to use the protein and the fat you eat.  Vitamins should not be taken without food because they are like an enzyme that helps to put the food to use.  Some people fast or skip meals and then take vitamins believing they're helping themselves.  When you do take vitamin supplements, you should take them with your food, and you should depend on your food as your primary nutrient source.
<p><dd>
Vitamin B-12 deficiencies could result in pernicious anemia.  Only a few cases of dietary B-12 deficiencies have been reported in scientific literature, and those cases were associated with intestinal disorders.  If there was an absorption problem, there would be an intrinsic factor enzyme that would be absent because of a disease of the stomach or small intestines.  In that event, although you were getting enough B-12, you may not be able to absorb it and you may need an injection once every three months.  Equally effective, according to the British Medical Journal (291:56,1985), would be one large daily dose, 1000 mcg. in a liquid sublingual form(under the tongue as drops, spray, or dissolvable tablet).  A diseased body could absorb the needed 1-2 mg. per day, which would solve the problem. 
<p><dd>
Doctors can diagnose possible Vitamin B-12 deficiencies with blood tests through reports on the complete blood cell counts (CBC) and the anemia panel, which measures the level of Vitamin B-12, folic acid and iron.  The live blood morphology test can identify B-12 deficiencies.  The red blood cells become shaped like an oval (ovalocytes) instead of being round and the white blood cells have fewer lobes than expected.  Excess B-12 has not been reported as a toxic problem.  Many vegetarians take Vitamin B-12 in a B complex twice or three times a week in a sublingual form under the tongue.   
<p><dd>
You do need at least four micrograms per day, which is a very small amount.  Since your body can store Vitamin B-12 from five to ten years in the liver, we have an adequate storage capacity. However, excessive use of alcohol can deplete a years supply.  B-12 is manufactured by certain bacterial algae (no animal or plant produces B-12).  Some foods that provide Vitamin B-12 from bacteria would include one ounce of oysters that has five micrograms and two ounces of crab (5.7 micrograms).  An occasional bit of oyster or crab sprinkled into your food would give you a source of B-12.  Two ounces of herring per day would give you five micrograms your minimum B-12 requirement for the day. 
<p><dd>
Supermarkets and health food stores now provide several grain products fortified with added Vitamin B-12.  Nutrigrain cereal have fortified their rice and corn flakes, so one to two cups would meet all your B-12 requirements.  Tempeh miso (fermented soybean) and tamari are both fermented by bacteria that manufacture sufficient B-12.  Other non-animal sources of B-12 include the algae, spirulina and seaweed with bacteria clinging to its surface.  
<p><dd>
<strong>Vitamin B12</strong>  RDA: 4 mcg.   Supplement pills contain breakdown of B-12 and are not used as efficiently as the whole foods listed below.  Friendly micro­organisms (algae, bacteria) provide the ideal source of B-12 between 4 to 25 mcg./day.  If the "intrinsic factor" enzyme (produced by your body) is absent, your body would not absorb this vitamin properly.  The doctor may decide you need injections or sublingual form of B-12.  Fortunately, this deficiency is rare.  No toxicity has been reported by overdose.

<strong><u>VITAMIN B-1</u></strong>  Vitamin B-1, thiamin, has been discovered to be very essential to good health.  If you do not get enough B-1, it can lead to fatigue, loss of appetite, emotional problems, beriberi, excess hyperthyroidism, shingles and in severe cases - death.  The RDA for Vitamin B-1 is set at 1 to 1.8 milligrams.  It's important to take the B-1 as a complex, when you do use it as a supplement.  A supplement range could be safe from two to one hundred milligrams per day.  The higher dosage would be taken if you consume large amounts of alcohol or sugars.  The lower dosage of two milligrams would be used as a preventive formula in combination with the other B complex vitamins.
<p><dd>
To get proper B-1 from your foods, you could use sprouted sunflower seeds.  Just one cup per day meets your entire Vitamin B-1 requirement.  Millet, split peas, green peas, bulgar wheat, asparagus and brown rice are all good sources of B-1.  B-1 deficiencies occur when people eat large amount of processed foods, such as white bread, white rice, sugars and alcohol.  Because there is not enough Vitamin B-1 in processed white flour and sugar to metabolize all the carbohydrates.  It's best to switch to whole natural foods, such as whole wheat bread with all its B Vitamins intact instead of white bread.
<p><dd>
<strong>Vitamin B1</strong>  RDA: 1 - 1.8 mg.   Supplement must be taken as a B complex (with other B's) in range from 2 to 100 mg./day.  The better your diet, the less you need supplements.  The more processed white flours, sugar or alcohol you use, the higher the dosage of B's.

<strong><u>VITAMIN B-2 RIBOFLAVIN</u></strong>  Riboflavin is essential to good health, but it's the most common deficiency Americans develop.  It is important for the maintenance of adequate antioxidant enzyme levels. The RDA has been set at 1.4 to 2 milligrams.  To meet your needs, include the following foods that are good sources of B-2: wild rice, millet, mushrooms, collards, broccoli, various beans and peas.  Deficiencies can occur, and they may show up as cracks in the corners of your mouth and children’s growth also can be affected.

<strong><u>VITAMIN B-3</u></strong>  The RDA for niacin, Vitamin B-3, has been established between 15-20 milligrams. Niacin supplements raise the good cholesterol (HDL) and lower the total cholesterol.  It can dilate blood vessels thus lower blood pressure while improving circulation.  It has been shown help in the reduction of migraine headaches. 1 1/2 cups of broccoli would meet a majority of your requirements for the day.  Sprouted sunflower seeds, split peas, mushrooms and beans are all good sources.
<p><dd>
If you develop a deficiency of B-3 it can lead to pellagra, a condition in which the skin develops small spots that look like dirt or suntan.  It can lead to paralysis and death.  But, you can get too much niacin and excesses above 1,000 milligrams per day have been known to cause headache, liver damage and possible blindness.  Time-released Niacinamide has been shown to be safer (between 20 -200 milligrams per day) however, don't exceed our recommended dosages.   Any dose beyond this should be under the care and direction of a physician.
<p><dd>
<strong>Vitamin B3 Niacin</strong>  RDA: 15 - 20 mg.  Niacin deficiency may cause depression, insomnia or pellagra (dermatitis, diarrhea, etc.).  A safe supplement range is 20 to 200 mg. per day.  Over 200 mg. of niacin may harm the delicate blood vessels in the eye due to excessive dilation.  Niacinamide does not have this effect; but, dosages of 2,000 mg. may cause liver damage, depression and gout.  Food is your best source, with supplements in moderation.

<strong><u>VITAMIN B-6</u></strong>  This vitamin is called pyridoxine and the RDA is set at two milligrams.  It is needed to metabolize amino acids and for the formation of hemoglobin in red blood cells.  If you eat two cups of brown rice per day, this would meet most of your B-6 requirements.  Bananas are also a good source, as are chestnuts, one of the few nuts low in fat.

<strong><u>VITAMIN C</u></strong>  This is one of the most important and most remarkable nutrients.  It has a unique effect on the basic properties of molecules, tissues and cells.  It has a large range of metabolic functions.  It is essential for the production of collagen and offers protection from oxidative free radical damage.  Because of the collagen strength and the antioxidant activity, wrinkling and sagging of the skin is reduced.  Interferon production is enhanced with Vitamin C, which promotes immune function.  The RDA for this vitamin is 60 milligrams and you could get this amount from one orange.  You might not be aware strawber­ries have twice the Vitamin C as oranges, broccoli has three times more, red peppers have four times as much and red, hot chili peppers have seven times as much more Vitamin C per cup quantity.
<p><dd>
Remember, to get the most Vitamin C, it's always best to eat these foods as fresh as possible, either when they come from the tree or fresh from your sprouting jar.  When you take a supplement, the range would be from 60-500 milligrams per day.  In certain instances you may have been advised to take more than 1,000 milligrams by your physician, and if so, you should follow those guidelines.

Your body can store Vitamin C in your white blood cell buffycoat.  Most people can saturate their storage capacity, if they get at least 100 milligrams of Vitamin C per day.  A lack of Vitamin C usually only occurs if you're deprived of fruits and vegetables or in a more serious situation of starvation.  This lack of Vitamin C can lead to scurvy - bleeding gums, sores, loose teeth, swollen legs and possible death.  Take supplements derived from all fresh fruits and vegetables.  This will supply you with a good source of Vitamin C and the necessary bioflavonid complex.

<strong><u>VITAMIN D</u></strong>  The RDA is established at 400 I.U.; a safe supplement range would be up to 400 I.U.  It would be best not to exceed this amount, because too much Vitamin D could lead to a type of calcification of the arteries.  In England this overdose side effect had been reported in infants.  Now in that country, you can only get Vitamin D by prescription.
<p><dd>
Your best source of Vitamin D is the sunlight.  By stepping outdoors for 15 minutes, you will allow your body to produce all the Vitamin D it requires.  It may be a cloudy day, but if part of your face and skin are exposed, you'll produce vitamin D.  However, as we age, our ability to produce vitamin D in the skin decline and our ability to absorb it is reduced.  It is common for older people to have less exposure to the sun and poorer intestinal absorption.  If liver or kidney or bowel disorders are present, you need a supplement of Vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol).  This form works best with the parathyroid hormone to maintain normal blood levels of calcium.  Vitamin D from milk is a less desirable synthetic form and it should not be depended upon for your health. 
<p><dd>
<strong>Vitamin D</strong>  RDA: 400 I.U.
<p><dd>
Supplement range under 400 I.U.  15 minutes outdoors in daylight allows your body to produce all the required Vitamin D.  If climate or clothing does not permit this, a growing child would need a supplement or 3 oz. of fish per day (vitamin D is found in fish oil).

<strong><u>COENZYME Q10</u></strong> is essential for the production ATP (adenosine triphosphate) in the mitochondria.  ATP is the molecule that our cells use to store energy.  A fat soluble antioxidant nutrient, Coenzyme Q10 is not a vitamin.  It declines with illness and with age.  Tissue levels of CoQ10 are lower especially after the age of 40.  Supplements of CoQ10  increase exercise tolerance and reduce angina.  It can improve the strength of the heart muscle and reduce shortness of breath.  There are reports of patients being able to avoid heart transplant surgery because of the dramatic improvements from taking CoQ10.  It has been shown to reduce inflammation of the gum as well as stimulating normal immune function.  Sugar metabolism in diabetes improves as well as the improvement of metabolic rate and the slowing of the aging process.  
<p><dd>
The amount of coenzyme Q10 I take is 50 - 150 mg per day.  In severe heart disease higher doses can be more beneficial.  CoQ10 is not toxic although it is fat soluble.  It does not accumulate excessively in the tissues.

<strong><u>ZINC</u></strong> supplements can help someone with vision problems caused from cirrhosis of the liver.  It can also help men on kidney dialysis machines who have become sexually impotent.  During the processing of foods much zinc is lost.  Most of us do not obtain enough of this trace mineral .  Colorado Medical Center Researchers have shown that if cereals were fortified with zinc much of the deficiencies from middle-income as well as low-income families would be eliminated. Good sources of this mineral are garbanzo beans, whole-wheat flour, wheat bran, lentil and soybean sprouts.  A supplement between 15-50 milligrams is a reasonable amount.
<p><dd>
<strong>Zinc</strong>  RDA: 15 to 25 mg. Supplement range 15 to 50 mg.

<strong><u>SELENIUM</u></strong>  The amount of selenium in food varies depending on the concentration in soil where it was grown.  The basic RDA is .05 to 2 milligrams.  Onions, cabbage, carrots, potatoes, tomatoes, grains, cereals, fruits and vegetables are all sources of selenium.  The Grow Young Plan is higher in selenium than most typical diets.  Some studies seem to suggest selenium reduces the risk of heart disease.  Of course, people eating the most selenium were also eating more whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and as we already know, these foods are low in fat and cholesterol.  As a result, it's not clear if selenium is the main factor in lowering the risk of heart disease.  But, selenium is an anti-oxidant and can help improve and maintain good health by reducing the effects of processed foods.
<p><dd>
<strong>Selenium</strong> RDA 50 mcg/day (.05 to .20 mg/day) Supplement range 50 to 100 mcg. per day (.05 to .10 mg.).  Toxic at 5,000 mcg. (5 mg./day) long-term use.  Foods vary greatly in concentration of selenium; depends on the amount present in soil.

<strong><u>IRON</u></strong>  There is more iron in the body than any of the other trace elements.  The red blood cells, as part of the hemoglobin, are where it is mostly present. The RDA's for iron are 10 milligrams for men and 18 for women.  The supplement amount also should stay in this range.  Iron is needed to produce hemoglobin in the blood to carry oxygen and to prevent anemia, pallor and fatigue.  Dairy products frequently cause iron-deficiency anemia by inhibiting iron absorption (<em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition 33:86, 1988</em>).  If this problem develops, stop drinking cow's milk.  
<p><dd>
Too much iron can cause toxic side effects.  For example, an intake of over 200 milligrams per day has been known to lead to liver disorders.  If you took in 3 to 20 grams per day it could lead to iron overload of the liver and possible death.  The Bantu natives, who do all their cooking in iron pots, have a tremendous iron toxicity problem because excess iron gets into their food.  Iron overload kills more people, percentage-wise, in this culture than heart disease does in our country.  If you are cooking with iron pots every day, I would suggest you alternate with other types of cookware.
<p><dd>
<strong>Iron</strong>  RDA: 10 mg. for male, 18 mg. for female. Supplement range 10 to 18 mg./day.  Toxic side effects over 200 mg./day. Good sources of iron include sprouted sunflower seeds, garbanzo beans, lentils, parsley, split peas and seaweed.

<strong><u>CALCIUM</u></strong> is essential to good bone integrity, to maintain­ing strong healthy teeth and for proper nerve and muscle function­ing.  The RDA has been established at 800 to 1,200 milligrams.  This range can be easily met by eating a variety of foods, including turnip greens, collards, kale, cabbage, garbanzo beans, broccoli and corn tortillas.  There is more calcium in five tortillas than in a cup of milk.

<strong><u>MAGNESIUM</u></strong>  Magnesium helps to relax muscles after calcium stimulates muscle contraction.  It helps to regulate body temperature, acid-base balance, absorption & use of other minerals.  Small amounts of magnesium appear to help people with chronic insomnia, muscle cramps, headaches, depression and irregular heart rhythm.  High blood cholesterol levels, high protein diets, diuretics or alcoholism creates an increased need for magnesium.

<strong><u>POTASSIUM</u></strong>  Potassium is needed for fluid balance with sodium regulation.  We need about 2,500 milligrams of potassium per day.

<strong><u>SODIUM</u></strong>  You may consider yourself already educated about sodium. You've made a good start! Sodium is naturally found in whole foods such as grains, beans, fruits and vegetables. Unless your physician has advised you to eat a very low sodium diet, the sodium level of these foods need not concern you. A diet composed of these foods, eaten in their natural state, will supply you with a good amount of sodium needed for body function. We need just the right amount of Sodium, not too much or too little.  Be careful of getting too much sodium from processed foods - those jars and bottles, boxes and bags in your cupboard and refrigerator!
<p><dd>
But it's just not possible to guess the sodium level in a package by reading a simple list of ingredients. The only way to be certain of the sodium content is if the manufacturer has included a nutritional disclosure statement. Don’t assume sodium is low just because it is listed lastThe United States government recently declared a standard for food manufacturers making nutritional claims.  The manufacturer may claim "No Added Salt," but still use other compounds or ingredients already containing sodium.  Salt is necessary in small amounts with 2,000 mg in one half teaspoon. We need about 4,000 mg (teaspoon) for two liters of water in a day and up to 6,000 mg for active people who drink a lot of water and eat over 10 servings of vegetables and fruit.
<br><br><p><dd>
<em>* Whole natural, unprocessed foods have been listed that you and your family may currently be consuming fresh, or need to add as a source for nutrients. Certain foods (liver, egg yolks, cheese, etc.) were not listed because they are too high in such harmful substances as fat, cholesterol and salt.  You would be best advised to eat the other foods that are safe to eat, based on the facts explained in this book, Grow Young and Slim.</em>
