				<p><strong>Mobile Intentions'</strong>mission is to be your online destination for wireless service across America. We strive to be the best place to learn about, buy and compare wireless phone services.

				<p><strong>Mobile Intentions</strong> understands that the thought of purchasing a wireless phone can sometimes be quite intimidating. After all, they come in so many different sizes, colors, and price ranges. Even if you have a good idea of how much you want to spend and what you want your new wireless phone to look like, you still have to consider the technical options; wireless phones are available with numerous features, several types of batteries and operate in different modes.</p>

				<p>Let one of our experienced staff assist you in making your decision. We provide a broad range of phones, rate plans and accessories, ensuring the right solution for you. Being a national dealer for <em>T-Mobile</em> allows us to offer programs that very few can. Most of these programs are only available through <strong>Mobile Intentions</strong> and can not be purchased at any retail store.</p>

				<p>Please call us toll-free at <strong>(888)888-5715</strong>. A representitive will evaluate your current wireless situation.
