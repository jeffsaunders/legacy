				<p><strong class="bigBlack"><u>Do I qualify for these offers if I am an existing customer with T-Mobile?</u></strong><br>
				These programs require new service on a voice plan $39.99 or higher for all mail-in rebates on basic phones. Mail-in rebates are only eligible for data devices (PDAs, Smart Phones, BlackBerrys, Treos) if you activate on a $39.99 or higher voice plan and an unlimited data plan per your device. This will typically be outlined and explained next to the image of the device on our order site. If you are a current customer, this offer will be valid if you activate a new primary number account that is not under an existing account. Mail-in rebates are not valid if you are adding lines to a Family Plan, renewing your service, or upgrading or adding services to your existing account. If you would like the latest deals on upgrading your current phone or service, please visit <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com" target="_blank" class="bodyBlack">www.t-mobile.com</a>.</p>

				<p><strong class="bigBlack"><u>Can I keep my existing cell phone number?</u></strong><br>
				If you already have service with T-Mobile and you want to have your new service activated with the same wireless carrier, then you will have to activate new service and receive a new phone number. If you are switching wireless carriers, then yes, due to number portability laws, all cellular carriers are required to transfer your number to the carrier of your choice. You should initiate this process after you receive your new phone. Instructions on how to do this are included with your new phone or you may view them by clicking here: <a href="?sec=porting" class="bodyBlack">Porting Instructions</a>. The transfer will require a phone call and it normally takes less than 24 hours to complete the transfer. You should not cancel your current phone service until after the transfer has been completed.</p>

				<p><strong class="bigBlack"><u>Are there any penalties for canceling my new service with T-Mobile?</u></strong><br>
				All activations will require a two-year agreement with the wireless carrier, failure to keep your service activated for this term will result in a deactivation fee from the wireless carrier you activated service with in the amount of $150 to $200 per activated device. You will have 14 days to cancel your service without having to pay these fees. You will still be responsible for paying the $35.00 activation fee and any usage of service.</p>

				<p><strong class="bigBlack"><u>I have been told that I need to "Migrate" or "Upgrade" my account, what does that mean?</u></strong><br>
				<ul>
				<li><strong>Migrations: </strong>
				The wireless service providers define a migration as a customer moving their service from TDMA to GSM. TDMA is an older technology that is rarely used anymore and customer\'s are being forced to move to the newer digital service, which is GSM. The important thing to realize is that your service remains with the same wireless service provider and is not treated as a new activation, therefore we do not receive commissions and are unable to discount your new device. Please contact your wireless service provider directly if you need to migrate your service from TDMA to GSM and they will provide you a discount on your new equipment. Migrations currently do not exist with T-Mobile.</li><br><br>

				<li></li><strong>Upgrades: </strong>
				The wireless service providers define an upgrade as a customer requesting to extend their agreement in return for a new phone or device that is either free or heavily discounted. Mobile Intentions is not compensated for this from the wireless service providers since it is not a new activation, but instead, a continuance of service with the same wireless service provider. Therefore, cannot discount your device in this situation. Please contact T-Mobile directly for an upgrade, they will personally ofer you a discount on your equipment with an upgrade. Their website is <a href="http://www.t-mobile.com" target="_blank" class="bodyBlack">www.t-mobile.com</a>.</li></p>
				</ul>

				<p><strong class="bigBlack"><u>Are these new or refurbished devices?</u></strong><br>
				All phones distributed under this offer are brand new in the original manufacturer\'s packaging and have never been used.</p>

				<p><strong class="bigBlack"><u>What are the requirements and associated cancellation fees to receive these special offers from Mobile Intentions?</u></strong><br>
				All T-Mobile activations must remain active for 120 days on the minimum required rate plan(s) or the customer will be charged $350 for each Rim Blackberry device, $350 for each Side Kick device, $300 for each Motorola Razor device and $200 for any other device received through these offers.</p>

				Customer will have 14 days to cancel service (from date of activation) and 30 days to return the device and avoid the Mobile Intentions per device fees. All returned devices must be complete in box, in like new condition, mailed and received at the address below within 30 days of activation to avoid being charged.<br><br>
