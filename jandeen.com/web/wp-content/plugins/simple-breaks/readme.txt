Simple Breaks adds in shortcodes for everyday html elements that normally get removed by visual mode

== Description ==

Simple Breaks adds in shortcodes for everyday html elements that normally  get removed by visual mode

== Usage ==

Place the shortcodes inside your post/page for the desired effect:

* **[br]** - Adds in a line break, accepts the attributes id and class.
* **[clearleft]** - does not allow content floating to the left of it, pushes all the content below it down, accepts the attributes id, class and span.
* **[clearright]** - does not allow content floating to the right of it, pushes all the content below it down, accepts the attributes id, class and span.
* **[clearboth]** - does not allow content floating to the left or the right of it, pushes all the content below it down, accepts the attributes id, class and span.
* **[hr]** - Horizontal Rule, draws a line across the page, accepts the attributes id, size class and color.
* **[space]** - Blank space, empty, nothing, pushes content down, accepts the attributes id, size and class.

The span attribute in **[clearleft]** **[clearright]** **[clearboth]** allows an override of the default tag used.  when span=false (default) the tag used will be a div, however when span=true the tag used will be a span.
for example [clearleft span=true] will use a span tag instead of a div tag, and [clearleft] will use a div tag as default
