<div align="justify">
	Since 1988, Dennis Tobler has been writing, producing, directing, starring 
	in and distributing the popular nationally syndicated television show 
	Football Forecast Weekly.</div>
<div align="justify">
	&nbsp; <font color="#FFFFFE"><span style="font-size: 0.1pt">Professional handicapper, football handicapper prediction</span></font></div>
<div align="justify"> 
	The Football Forecast Weekly website has been the home page for Las Vegas based professional 
	handicapper extrordinaire Dennis Tobler, since 1996. Mr. Tobler 
	has been a fixture in the sports gaming and horse race handicapping business 
	in Las Vegas for over 21 years.</div>
<div align="justify">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div align="justify">
	As owner of the TSI Network, Tobler is one of the most sought after 
	celebrities in the business. He has appeared as the principle talent on over 
	220 nationally televised shows and thousands of radio programs in the past 
	21 years. His expertise is unmatched and for that reason he acts as a 
	consultant to many sports books around the world.</div>
<div align="justify">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div align="justify">
	The 2006 season will find Mr. Tobler starring in the national television 
	production Football Forecast Weekly, which is in its 14th year of 
	production. Not only one of the longest running programs of it's type, it 
	was tabbed by the Orange County Register in Anaheim, CA as the BEST SHOW 
	EVER when it comes to imparting football information.</div>
<div align="justify">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div align="justify">
	Dennis Tobler is a life-long sports participant and sports and horse race 
	bettor. For the last 21+ years, the Nebraska-born and football-bred Tobler 
	has been one of the country's top handicappers. He is one of a handful of 
	experts who helps set the line in Las Vegas and offshore. His sources run 
	very deep in this close knit business.</div>
<div align="justify">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div align="justify">
	During the 1960's, Tobler was a two-time all-state football player in 
	Nebraska, where they really know their football! During the 1970's, Tobler 
	broke nearly every private bookmaker in the Midwest. By 1980, Tobler moved 
	his tack to Las Vegas, where the rest is history. <br>
	Tobler has been a sports handicapper and entrepreneur since 1972. Doing 
	business as TSI Network, he founded his sports information service in Las 
	Vegas in 1982, then one of only four licensed services, to sell sports and 
	horse racing handicapping information through &quot;800,&quot; &quot;900,&quot; and &quot;976&quot; 
	telephone services.</div>
<div align="justify">

<div align="justify">
	Beginning in 1988, Tobler began television syndication of &quot;Football Forecast 
	Weekly&quot; and horse racing specials. These infomercials advertise TSI's sports 
	information service. With a potential viewing audience of 50 million 
	households, these programs have consistently generated customers for TSI's 
	handicapping service and worldwide industry products.</div>
<div align="justify">
	&nbsp;</div>
<div align="justify">
	Since the inception of the offshore gaming industry, Mr. Tobler has become a 
	major player in all aspects, from consulting on software and business setup 
	to actually filming television programs in Antigua, St. Kitts, Curacao, and 
	of course, Costa Rica, where he offers his reknowned football handicapper
	predictions.</div>
