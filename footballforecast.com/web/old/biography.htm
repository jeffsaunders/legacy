  Tobler has been writing, producing, directing, starring in and distributing 
  the popular nationally syndicated television show Football Forecast Weekly. 
  The Football Forecast Weekly website has been the home page for professional 
  Las Vegas handicapper extrordinaire Dennis Tobler, since 1996. Mr. Tobler has 
  been a fixture in the sports gaming and horse race handicapping business in 
  Las Vegas for over 20 years. As owner of the TSI Network, Tobler is one of the 
  most sought after celebrities in the business. He has appeared as the principle 
  talent on over 220 nationally televised shows and thousands of radio programs 
  in the past 20 years. His expertise is unmatched and for that reason he acts 
  as a consultant to many sports books around the world.</b></font></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br>
  The 2004 season will find Mr. Tobler starring in the national television production 
  Football Forecast Weekly, which is in its 13th year of production. Not only 
  one of the longest running programs of it's type, it was tabbed by the Orange 
  County Register in Anaheim, CA as the BEST SHOW EVER when it comes to imparting 
  football information.</font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Dennis Tobler is 
  a life-long sports participant and sports and horse race bettor. For the last 
  20+ years, the Nebraska-born and football-bred Tobler has been one of the country's 
  top handicappers. He is one of a handful of experts who helps set the line in 
  Las Vegas and offshore. His sources run very deep in this close knit business. 
  </font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">During the 1960's, 
  Tobler was a two-time all-state football player in Nebraska, where they really 
  know their football! During the 1970's, Tobler broke nearly every private bookmaker 
  in the Midwest. By 1980, Tobler moved his tack to Las Vegas, where the rest 
  is history. </font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Tobler has been 
  a sports handicapper and entrepreneur since 1972. Doing business as TSI Network, 
  he founded his sports information service in Las Vegas in 1982, then one of 
  only four licensed services, to sell sports and horse racing handicapping information 
  through &quot;800,&quot; &quot;900,&quot; and &quot;976&quot; telephone services. 
  </font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Beginning in 1988, 
  Tobler began television syndication of &quot;Football Forecast Weekly&quot; 
  and horse racing specials. These infomercials advertise TSI's sports information 
  service. With a potential viewing audience of 50 million households, these programs 
  have consistently generated customers for TSI's handicapping service and worldwide 
  industry products. </font></b></p>
<p align="center"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Since the inception 
  of the offshore gaming industry, Mr. Tobler has become a major player in all 
  aspects, from consulting on software and business setup to actually filming 
  television programs in Antigua, St. Kitts, Curacao, and of course, Costa Rica.
