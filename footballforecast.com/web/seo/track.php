<p>Text:<br>
Sean Lahman and Todd Greanier have improved upon their years of work with even 
more groundbreaking statistics, larger, more in-depth player analyses, and a 
brand-new projection system sure to be a valuable tool in fantasy drafts. The 
work of the Football Outsiders and the rest of their team of experts brings even 
more insight into the game.<br>
<br>
Eric Neel of ESPN.com tagged it as &quot;paradigm-shifting work.&quot; King Kaufman of 
Salon.com declared &quot;I’ve learned so much . . . that my ignorance is threatening 
to turn into insight.&quot; Bob Carroll, co-author of The Hidden Game of Football, 
proclaimed it &quot;a great addition to anyone’s pro football library.&quot; You’ll simply 
label it &quot;indispensable&quot; as you use it to bone up on the upcoming 2004 football 
season or research your fantasy draft.<br>
<br>
More and more people are discovering this to be the one publication they need 
prior to the NFL season. With stats and evaluations of every player from every 
team the Forecast goes beyond those puny magazines for a complete and thorough 
investigation into all things football. DPro evaluates defensive players by 
position; Adjusted Yards compares the contributions of offensive skill players 
and special teams players; there’s even a method of looking at kickers to take 
into account touchbacks and pooch punts, chipshots and longshots.<br>
<br>
The pigskin prognosticators also discuss each team’s chances for success this 
year, including a unique statistical examination that applies to that team 
specifically as well as the league in general. Does passing make any sense in 
short-yardage situations? Do officials call fewer penalties in the playoffs? At 
what record could a team fire its coach and expect improvement? The answers are 
all there in the Forecast.<br>
<br>
So treasure your Pro Football Forecast. It’s all you need to watch the 2004 
season from a fresh new angle, amazing your friends and gaining admirers of the 
opposite sex at the same time. You should share your secret of success—nobody 
likes the selfish—but make sure your friends buy their own instead of stealing 
it from you. Just hold on tight and don’t let go, and your Forecast will show 
you the NFL as you’ve never seen it before!<br>
<br>
About the Authors<br>
Sean Lahman is a pioneer of making sports data publicly available. As a writer, 
he has contributed to The Football Analyst, Total Baseball, Baseball: The 
Biographical Encyclopedia, and Total Tennis. Todd Greanier has written about 
football for more than ten years, and he and Lahman founded The Football Project 
in 1998. Research by the two has appeared in publications such as Pro Football 
Weekly, Sports Business Journal, and Cigar Aficionado, and in numerous online 
articles.</p>
		<p>Professional Football is upon us again and Intellicast will provide 
		you with all the necessary weather information so that you can visit 
		your favorite team's facilities. Will Lambeau Field actually live up to 
		its nickname of the Frozen Tundra, will it be windy and cold at Ralph 
		Wilson Stadium or will showers and thunderstorms be in the Miami or 
		Tampa Bay area for the game. Find your favorite team below!</p>
		<p>This system looks at the statistically relevant team factors and uses 
		them to compute a predicted score for each team. The analysis of these 
		factors take into account the skill of the opposition for that week, as 
		well as the scoring efficiency of the teams you are handicapping, and 
		other pertinent statistics which have been proven to have the most 
		relevance affecting the scoring outcome. The information needed for each 
		week is simple to obtain on a weekly basis in your local newspaper or on 
		the internet! <br>
		<br>
		When both team's full data are input, the Predicted Final Score for both 
		team's are computed. Comparing the Predicted Final Score to the point 
		spread will show you the games that have the greatest variance, and 
		therefore the greatest chance of Winning Money!<br>
		<br>
		This is our third year selling this program over the internet (and on 
		ebay) and the results and feedback just keep improving! For the cost of 
		only $10 (which you will make back with your first winning week), you 
		will ensure yourself of a winning and profitable football year. You will 
		be the envy of your friends and co-workers as you climb to the top of 
		the pools and collect big $ weekly and at the end of the season as well!</p>

		Football Picks<br>
		To tell you a little about us and our football point spread picks, we 
		are known as the Wiseguys. We live in Las Vegas and make our living by 
		beating the vegas point spread season after season. Three years ago we 
		decided to expanded to the Internet and let the public in on our college 
		&amp; nflpicks and we have not let them down. Last year our NFL weekly picks 
		made $100 a unit players making $9850, and our College football game 
		picks made $100 a unit players making $7375. Better than just about any 
		other services so called nfl expert picks.<br>
		<br>
		We have a quality over quantity approach releasing about 4 football 
		betting picks per sport per week. While our football predictions are 
		considered by most to be the best around by no means are they expensive. 
		You may check out our affordable rates by clicking the Premium Picks 
		page which gives info on both our upcoming College and pro football 
		picks. We also invite you to sign up for Free Football Picks at the top 
		of the page as well as check out the special football sportsbook 
		specials of the right hand side of the page. <br>
		<br>
		College Football Picks<br>
		Like we stated earlier we do also handicap College football. Most people 
		visiting our website are football bettors and enjoy betting College 
		football just as much as the NFL. For this reason as well as the extra 
		money that can be earned per season we offer College football 
		predictions. To view what is on tap for this week, check out our College 
		football picks page.<br>
		<br>
		We are here to help you so if you have any questions about our 2005 
		College football spread picks feel free to email us anytime. Thanks and 
		good luck this season.<br>
