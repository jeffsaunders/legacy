		Mobile Broadband device sales system targeting benefits programs for groups.  Primarily aimed at employee benefits for mid to large size companies, but any organization is eligible, much like a Credit Union.<br><br>The system is entirely data-driven and is customized via a simple configuration specifying the particular benefits afforded each organization, such as their monthly discount from the carrier, the device price level, discounts and rebates, etc., as well as the organizations logo and contact information.<br><br>This design affords a more modular layout for maximum flexibility and an always-on-screen running shopping cart.
