<b><div align="center" style="font-size:18px;">eWomenNetwork PLATINUM<br>Terms and Conditions</div></b>

<p>These terms and conditions are designed to protect the integrity and exclusive nature of the eWomenNetwork PLATINUM offering. By clicking your acceptance of these terms and conditions, you irrevocably agree that, if eWomenNetwork, Inc. approves your Application and accepts your offer to participate as a PLATINUM level participant, then this eWomenNetwork PLATINUM Participant Agreement automatically becomes a binding agreement between you and eWomenNetwork, Inc. By clicking your acceptance of these terms and conditions, you are acknowledging that you have read, agree to and accept all of the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement. eWomenNetwork may amend this Agreement at any time by sending you the amendment and/or modification in writing and give you a reasonable period within which to reject same by terminating your eWomenNetwork PLATINUM participation, understanding that your failing to timely do so will be deemed an acceptance of the terms as amended.</p> 

<p>Exclusive invitations to PLATINUM-only events will be hosted by Sandra and Kym Yancey. A minimum of one (1) PLATINUM VIP event will be offered each year. Only PLATINUM members will receive complimentary registration for these events. <u>Please be advised that PLATINUM members who partake in these VIP events, must still pay for their personal travel, accommodations and ground transportation costs, and an event hospitality services fee, which include, but are not limited to, food and refreshments and associated materials.</u></p>
 
<p>By completing the eWomenNetwork PLATINUM Application along with your payment, you authorize eWomenNetwork to charge your credit or debit card, or cash your check, as indicated above, as payment for your participation in the PLATINUM Program, if eWomenNetwork approves your Application and accepts you into the Program. This is not an installment contract. Upon eWomenNetwork's acceptance of your offer and participation, you agree to payment in full for your access to, and opportunity to participate in the PLATINUM Program. The entire amount is due and payable immediately. eWomenNetwork may enter into a payment plan with you and allow you to submit periodic payments. You are, however, responsible for payment of the entire amount agreed upon. To further clarify, no refunds will be issued and if you have chosen a payment plan, all scheduled payments must be paid on a timely basis whether you participate in the program or not.</p>

<p>If accepted, I understand that the auto draft of $16.95 per month for my standard membership fee will cease beginning the moth <u>after</u> my PLATINUM application has been <u>completely</u> processed.</p>

<p>We are committed to providing all PLATINUM level participants with a positive PLATINUM Program experience. By accepting these terms and conditions, you agree that eWomenNetwork may, at its sole discretion, terminate this Agreement, and limit, suspend, or terminate your participation in the PLATINUM Program without refund or forgiveness of remaining monthly payments if you fail to follow the Program guidelines, if you hinder, obstruct or otherwise attempt to impair the participation of Program instructors or other participants in the PLATINUM Program, or become disruptive or difficult to work with in the sole discretion of eWomenNetwork.</p>
 
<p>Immediate grounds for termination from the PLATINUM Program, without refund, include but are not limited to the following:</p>

<ul>
	<p>1. Spamming other members with unsolicited email blasts</p>
	<p>2. Allowing or instructing others to represent that they are you, or that they have been authorized by you to gain entrance to PLATINUM events and resources</p>
	<p>3. Distributing information intended exclusively for PLATINUM members to others that are not registered in the PLATINUM Program.</p>
</ul>

<p>We respect your privacy and must insist that you respect the privacy of fellow PLATINUM Program participants. By clicking your acceptance of these terms and conditions, you agree not to violate the publicity or privacy right of any PLATINUM Program participant.

By clicking your acceptance of these terms and conditions, you agree (1) not to infringe any Program participant's or the eWomenNetwork's copyright, patent, trademark, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights, (2) that any Confidential Information shared by Program participant or any representative of the eWomenNetwork (the "Discloser" as applicable) is confidential and proprietary, and belongs solely and exclusively to the Discloser, (3) Participant agrees not to disclose such information to any other person or use it in any manner other than in discussion with other PLATINUM Program participants during Program sessions. By clicking your acceptance of these terms and conditions, you further agree that (4) all materials and information provided to you by eWomenNetwork is its own exclusive confidential and proprietary intellectual property,  and may only be used by you as authorized by  eWomenNetwork and (5) the reproduction, use, distribution and/or sale of these materials by anyone other than eWomenNetwork is strictly prohibited. Further, by clicking your acceptance of these terms and conditions, you agree that, if you violate, or threaten to violate any of your agreements contained in this paragraph, eWomenNetwork will be entitled to injunctive relief to prohibit any such violations to protect against the irreparable harm that would come from such violations.</p>

<p>We have made an effort to accurately represent the PLATINUM Program and its potential. Any testimonials and examples used are not intended to represent or guarantee that anyone will achieve the same or similar results. Each individual's success depends on many factors, including her or his background, dedication, desire and motivation. By clicking your acceptance of these terms and conditions, you acknowledge that as with any business endeavor, there is an inherent risk of loss of capital and there is no guarantee that you will earn any money as a result of your participation in the PLATINUM Program. By clicking your acceptance of these terms and conditions, you also acknowledge that you have represented to eWomenNetwork that payment of your PLATINUM participation fee in any of our programs and the initiation fee will not place a significant financial burden on you or your family.</p>

<p>You may, if you elect, cancel your lifetime participation in the PLATINUM program at any time. However, your PLATINUM initiation fee is non-refundable. If you cancel, and you have any PLATINUM program payments still due by you, you agree to make such payments.</p>
 
<p>The Program instructors are not qualified to provide legal, tax, accounting or financial advice, and the information provided to you by the Program instructors is not intended as such. You should refer all legal, tax, accounting and financially-related inquires to appropriately qualified professionals.</p>

<p>The acceptance of these terms and conditions shall be constructed in accordance and governed by the laws of the State of Texas.</p>

<p>Any action brought under this contract must be brought in Dallas County in the State of Texas. Furthermore, by entering into this agreement each party agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of Dallas County in the State of Texas for purposes of any action which arises out of or under this agreement.</p>

<p>If any provision, clause, terms, or words of this Agreement are declared void or unenforceable, such provisions, clause, terms or words shall be deemed severed from this Agreement and all remaining provisions, clause, terms or words shall otherwise remain in full force and effect.</p>

<p>In the event of any breach of this Agreement and action for enforcement hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to have and recover from the other party all costs, expenses and attorney's fees reasonably incurred thereby, together with interest at the highest rate permitted by law on any and all amounts deemed to be due and owing (including costs, expenses, and attorney's fees) which interest shall accrue from the date of any such claim or amount which has arisen until fully paid.</p>

<p>Neither party shall assign this Agreement without the written consent of the other.</p>

If you are not approved, any PLATINUM initiation fees paid by you will be refunded in full.</p>
