			Millions of single women bought homes last year.  They made up 20 percent of all buyers.<br/>
			<br/></span><span style="font-size: 14px; ">
			Single women world-wide are on a fast pace towards home ownership.  Times have drastically changed in just 30 years.    Women now make up over 50% of the workforce and also earn 58% of all college degrees.  A study done by Harvard University's Joint Center for housing found that single women buy approximately one million homes per year.<BR/>
			<BR/>
			So why are so many women buying homes now?  More and more women are waiting longer to get married and have a family.  Plus, women now have greater financial independence due to the economic gains in the workforce.  Single women are now building their own nest eggs with home equity.   Young women globally are becoming more independent and the dream of owning one's own home will be realized in other countries besides the United States as well.<BR/>
			<BR/>
			With the number of women purchasing homes increasing, there is a need for help navigating the world of real estate.<BR/>

			One of the biggest obstacles to single women is the lack of information about the home purchasing process, and understanding the dynamics of credit issues.  This leaves many women feeling intimidated by the whole buying process.
