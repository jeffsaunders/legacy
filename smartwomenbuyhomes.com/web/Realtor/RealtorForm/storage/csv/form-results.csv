"Rebecca D. Holt/REALTOR",Rebecca@KuschLandandRealty.com,903.271.8866,24/7,"I am a former Credit Analyst who accomplished my dream of becoming a Texas Realtor.  Funny, I choose a time that most other Agents were getting out of the business.  My work as a Credit Analyst is what inspired me.  I had the opportunity to help many people and their Agents achieve their goals of putting families back into stable living conditions.  That work was so rewarding it inspired me to forge ahead with my own personal goals.  I now live back in my home town where many single women are raising their children and need good, honest sound advice and also help with cleaning up the sometime messes that are left behind by family divorce.  
I would appreciate more information about your company and hope that you might consider me an asset to your organization.
Thank You!","2012-07-13 15:06:07",173.243.246.220,
