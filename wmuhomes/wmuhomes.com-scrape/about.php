	 <a href="http://www.macupdate.com/about.php" target="_blank">MacUpdate</a>, the fastest growing company in Michigan and the 114th fastest growing company in the USA (Inc. Magazine 2009), comes <a href="index.php">wmuhomes.com</a>.
	 <p>
	 We are internet professionals that understand how to create streamlined, user friendly websites that successfully market listings to niche audiences.
	 <p>
	 We market Macintosh software listings to over 7-million people a month through our MacUpdate resource. Locally in Kalamazoo, we're relaunching an initiative to market rental home listings to
	 WMU, K-College and KVCC students. If you're a student, go <a href="index.php">find a property</a> for next year!
	 <p>
	 wmuhomes.com is located in downtown Kalamazoo on beautiful South Street.
	 It was originally launched as a test in 2004 to measure the need for local property owners and students looking to connect. The average property listing was viewed by over 400 prospective students that spring!
	 <p>
	 As property owners ourselves, wmuhomes.com recognizes the newest challenges that landlords are facing, marketing their homes each spring, hoping to fill their homes for the upcoming fall. 
	 In the spring of 2010, wmuhomes.com has been reopened and we're now accepting new listings. 
	 Because each listing is important to us, our quality standard requires that every new listing has both interior and exterior photos.
	 If you are a landlord, please <a href="add2.php">add your rental property</a>. Listing on this site is currently free, as we're funded through other means, and this project is a passion.
	 <p>
	 <b>Thank you</b> for letting us work with you. Getting the best upkept rental homes listed is really important to us, and we're grateful for the opportunity to help market your home.
