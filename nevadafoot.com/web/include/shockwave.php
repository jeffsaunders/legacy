		<p align="left">Shockwave therapy is best known for its use in the treatment of kidney stones, referred to as Extracorporeal Shockwave Lithotripsy (ESWL).  Research has shown that shockwave therapy applied appropriately is also beneficial for the treatment of several orthopedic and podiatric conditions &mdash; this procedure is called <strong>Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy</strong>.</p>

		<p align="left">Nevada Foot Institute offers Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy (ESWT).  This non-invasive procedure is performed on an outpatient basis &mdash; it does not require open surgery or a hospital stay.  Patients may leave the treatment center shortly after the procedure is complete.</p>

		<p align="left">In October 2000, the FDA granted clearance of ESWT for the treatment of <a href="/index/info/plantar fasciitis" title="Plantar Fasciitis Information" class="bodyBlue">Plantar Fasciitis</a> (chronic heel pain syndrome) and in July 2002 granted clearance for the treatment of <a href="/index/info/epicondylitis" title="Epicondylitis Information" class="bodyBlue">Epicondylitis</a>.  Additional treatment indications are currently being researched.</p>

		<p align="left"><br><font size="3"><strong>How Does ESWT Work?</strong></font></p>
		
		<p align="left">Shockwave therapy works by triggering "messengers" that activate the body's own repair mechanisms to increase blood flow, change cell permeability, and enhance tendon healing.  Shockwaves also over-stimulate the nerves that may block the transmission of pain and lead to a reduction in sensitivity.</p>

		<p align="left">Prior to having ESWT, you will be asked for a list of all medications that you currently take.  It is important to include <strong>all</strong> medications, not only prescriptions.  Please list any over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, vitamins, or herbal remedies.</p>

		<p align="left">For safetly reason you are required to have someone drive you home from the treatment center, so please make arrangements prior to your treatment day.</p>

		<p align="left">Your physician may give you a prescription to take prior to your treatment.  Follow the instructions as prescribed.</p>

		<p align="left">Arrive at the treatment center one hour prior to the procedure.  Wear loose-fitting, comfortable clothing and shoes.  Once you arrive, you will be taken to the pre-op area for your treatment preparations.  If you are scheduled for local anesthesia, you will reccive it at that time.</p>

		<p align="left">During the treatment, the shockwave therapy head is placed in contact with the afflicted area.  A gel is used to ensure the therapeutic shockwaves are properly transmitted to the location of the pain.  Your physician targets the therapeutic waves via ultrasound imaging to achieve the optimal results.  The entire treatment process takes approximately 45 minutes.</p>

		<p align="left">Soon after your treatment you will be released and may be driven home by your designated driver.  After a short resting period and adhering to your physician's directions, you may return to normal activities.  Your physician will explain to you what you can expect after your treatment and you will be scheduled for a follow-up evaluation.</p>

		<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Insurance Coverage</strong></font></p>
		
		<p align="left">Extracorporeal Shockwave Therapy, ESWT, is considered an alternative therapy to surgical intervention.  To see how your insurance plan covers ESWT, ask your insurance provider if this is a covered benefit.  AKSM/Ortho may be an out-of-network service provider for this procedure.  An out-of-network provider may increase your financial responsibility for the treatment.
