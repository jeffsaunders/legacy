		<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Ingrown Toenail (Onychocryptosis)</strong></font></p>
		<p><strong>WHAT\'S THE PROBLEM?</strong></p>
		<p>An ingrown nail occurs when a portion of a toenail on either side of the toe turns downward and presses into the skin. Nails normally are nearly flat, with just a slight arcing downward at the borders. When the border of the nail is turned downward, it begins to injure the skin.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DOES IT FEEL?</strong></p>
		<p>Patient\'s usually feel pressure and eventually pain, as the hard and sharp nail edge creates further injury. Shoes that apply pressure to the toe increase the pain. If an infection develops, the pain becomes intolerable.</p>

		<p><strong>LET\'S DO A TEST!</strong></p>
		<p>An Ingrown Nail is identified by the doctor\'s physical exam. If an infection has developed, the doctor may send a sample of the drainage to a lab, to identify what bacteria has caused the infection and which antibiotics will most easily cure the infection.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?</strong></p>
		<p>A progression of events occurs. Routinely cutting the nails improperly, down at an angle instead of straight across, is the most common cause of Ingrown Nails. Wearing narrow or pointed shoes can apply enough pressure to a normal nail to turn the nail edge downward. Once the nail matrix, the tissue where the nail grows from, gets injured in this way, it continues to produce a nail edge that is more vertical than horizontal. From this abnormal nail growth, the nail edge applies mild pressure on the skin over a long period of time. The skin at the nail edge thickens and becomes hardened. You may begin to notice an enlargement or swelling of the skin around the nail edge. This can be accompanied by an increase in pain. The condition can progress as a result of other factors. These factors include: pressure from a tight or pointed shoe, injury such as stubbing a toe, excessive wetness, either from perspiration or application of ointments or creams, or improper cutting of nails If these factors come into play, the possibility increases that the nail edge can then penetrate the skin, just like a knife, and cause an infection. The skin at the nail edge becomes reddened and swollen. You may notice drainage or pus from the area and the pain becomes intolerable.</p>

		</tr>
		</table>

		<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>In mild cases, where no infection is present, pain relief can be obtained by applying a standard moisturizing cream to the nail edge and covering with a bandaid. This softens the hard skin and often provides temporary pain relief. In more advanced cases, where redness or obvious infection is present, seek the attention of a doctor.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT WILL MY DOCTOR DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>In the most minor cases, the podiatrist will simply cut the nail to shorten it, and show you how to cut the nail in the future, to prevent ingrowing of the nail again (See below for instructions on proper nail cutting). In more severe cases, but not those in which an infection hasn\'t developed, the podiatrist may gently remove the ingrown portion of the nail. This affords considerable relief, but is temporary. After a few weeks, when the nail grows long again, it will again grow in. In cases where the nail has grown in repeatedly, or more critically, when the nail edge has penetrated the skin and caused an infection, the podiatrist will perform a minor procedure called an Ingrown Nail Correction or Matricectomy. The podiatrist will gently numb your toe, reshape the nail edge and finally, apply a medicine which will, in most cases, permanently prevent the nail edge from growing improperly again.</p>

		<p><strong>CAN I PREVENT IF FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?</strong></p>
		<p>Cutting toe nails properly goes a long way toward the prevention of ingrown nails. Use a safety nail clipper, available at every drug store on the planet. Cut the nails STRAIGHT ACROSS, so that the nail corner is visible. If you cut the nail too short so that the nail corner is not visible, you are inviting the nail corner to grow into the skin. It is the natural tendency, when the edge of the nail starts to grow in, to cut down at an angle at the nail edge, to relieve the pain. This DOES relieve he pain TEMPORARILY, but it also starts the downward spiral, training the nail to become more and more ingrown. What happens is that cutting down at an angle creates a space at the nail edge. When the advancing nail edge reaches the space, it rolls downward, taking the course of least resistance. The edge becomes more and more ingrown, until it pierces the skin and makes an infection. So, cut the nails STRAIGHT ACROSS and never have an ingrown nail again.</p>

		<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Fungus Nail (Onychomycosis)</strong></font></p>

		<p><strong>WHAT\'S THE PROBLEM?</strong></p>
		<p>Fungus Nails is an unsightly infection of the nails, causing thickened, brittle, yellow, discolored and sometimes painful nails. It is very difficult to cure. It is caused by one of several microscopic organisms, similar to those that cause Athlete\'s Foot (dermatophytosis) These are plant like organisms that thrive in a dark, warm, moist environment, such as within shoes and stockings. They grow in the nail bed, beneath your nails, and live off Keratin, the protein in the nail. The condition usually begins toward the far end of the nail and may cause white or yellow-white areas that appear to be rotten or dead. If the infection continues to the base of the nail, it can invade the nail root (matrix) and cause the nail to grow thickened and deformed. Many people complain of a foul odor associated with this condition. It can also spread to other nails. The fungus often spreads to the adjacent skin surrounding the nail.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DOES IT FEEL?</strong></p>
		<p>It may not be painful in the beginning, and may only look slightly different than the normal nails. Later, the nail may begin to show small patches of white or yellowish-tan color and may become brittle and split. As it progresses, the nail becomes thicker and deformed and may begin to grow at an angle and become an Ingrown Nail. Pain develops, due to the ingrown or thickened nail deformity, and becomes aggravated by pressure applied by shoes. Inflammation can develop due to this pressure and a secondary bacterial infection may occur, leading to more pain. Even without inflammation, shoe pressure on the fungal nails can cause pain, making it difficult to walk or stand for periods of time. This can also influence one\'s involvement in day to day activities.</p>

		<p><strong>LET\'S DO A TEST!</strong></p>
		<p>Correct evaluation and diagnosis is important, as other common medical conditions, such as psoriasis, can look like Fungus Nails. Your doctor may make this decision by examination alone. He may also examine scrapings from the nail under the microscope or send these scrapings to the lab for accurate identification, to determine if the condition is a fungus and what type of fungus is responsible.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?</strong></p>
		<p>Many types of fungus are common in our environment. Among them are the dermatophytes, a group of opportunistic parasitic plant organisms, similar to molds or mildew, that, lacking chlorophyll, do not require sunlight for growth. Sweaty tennis shoes and moist socks create the perfect conditions for them. The funguses thrive in a warm, moist, dark environment and they eat the protein keratin that our skin produces. Although funguses may be present in the skin around the nails, one may not develop a nail infection without history of injury, such as bruised nails from short shoes, inflammation from an ingrown nail, or from cutting the nails incorrectly or too short. In other words, the organisms do not invade intact, healthy, normal skin or nails. Other contributing factors would be excessive perspiration, and Dermatophytosis (Athlete\'s Foot), which is caused by similar fungi. Some individuals appear to be more susceptible to infection. These would include those with medical conditions such as diabetes and poor circulation and HIV. For that reason, even if treatment is successful in eliminating the condition, the susceptible person may become re-infected in the future.</p>

		</tr>
		</table>

		<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>Topical medications are ineffective in most cases, because the infection starts growing under the nail. No topical medicines penetrate deep enough into and through the nail, to treat the living organisms under the nail plate. Any clearing of the nail surface is eventually overtaken by infected nail replacing it from underneath. Unfortunately, in this condition, any self treatment is, at best, temporary. Use of a topical antifungal medicine may, at best, prevent spread of the fungus to, as yet, unaffected nails or the surrounding skin.</p>

<!--		<p><strong>WHAT WILL MY DOCTOR DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>First of all, the doctor will do a physical examination to determine if there is a fungus present and not some other kind of medical condition. After determining the type of fungus, treatment may range from topical solutions to oral, systemic medications. The nails may be trimmed and reduced with an electric grinder periodically, and you may be asked to participate in some way at home. Surgical and/or laser treatment may address removal of part or all of the nail with additional medications to prevent recurrence as the new nail grows.<br><br>

Fortunately, oral medications are now available that have proven very effective in curing these difficult infections. These medicines reach the nail through the blood stream and create a barrier between the old infected nail, and the newly formed nail, effectively killing all living fungus organisms.. The medications are taken for about three months. During that time, they penetrate into and saturate the growing part of the nail. Even after you stop taking the medicine, the medicine that has gotten into the nail continues to treat the nail from inside for another six to nine months, until a healthy nail has completely grown out. The medicines seem expensive initially, but in the long run, they are more economical than previous long term treatments, and they offer a good chance of a cure. Although these medications are safe, there are some side effects in a small percentage of patients and they require a blood test to monitor blood levels. Your doctor will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of oral therapy and other alternatives with you, to determine the most appropriate treatment in your situation.</p>-->

		<p><strong>CAN I PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?</strong></p>
		<p>You may be asked to treat the insides of your shoes, which have become contaminated by the fungus. This is to make sure that the new healthy nail doesn\'t become contaminated by any fungus hiding in the shoe. To prevent the fungus infection from coming back, the best offense is a good defense. We must control moisture and create a drier environment for your feet. Use powder in shoes, to absorb perspiration. Avoid synthetic or nylon socks that trap, rather than absorb perspiration. Cotton socks absorb moisture and wick it away from the skin and nails. Keeping your feet dry and protected from injury is essential to avoid any fungus infections. If you have been cutting your nails too deeply, or treating an ingrown nail on your own, this may have allowed the fungus to grow under the nail. If shoes have become contaminated while you had the condition, they may be sanitized by spraying them with a topical antifungal spray, to prevent a recurrence of the Fungal Nail condition.</p>

		<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Bunions</strong></font></p>

		<p><strong>WHAT IS A BUNION?</strong></p>
		<p>Even though bunions are a common foot deformity, there are misconceptions about them. Many people may unnecessarily suffer the pain of bunions for years before seeking treatment. Bunions are often described as a bump on the side of the big toe. But a bunion is more than that. The visible bump actually reflects changes in the bony framework of the front part of the foot.With a bunion, the big toe leans toward the second toe, rather than pointing straight ahead. This throws the bones out of alignment- producing the bunion\'s 쿫ump. Bunions are a progressive disorder. They begin with a leaning of the big toe, gradually changing the angle of the bones over the years and slowly producing the characteristic bump, which continues to become increasingly prominent. Usually the symptoms of bunions appear at later stages, although some people never have symptoms.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT CAUSES A BUNION?</strong></p>
		<p>Bunions are most often caused by an inherited faulty mechanical structure of the foot. It is not the bunion itself that is inherited, but certain foot types that make a person prone to developing a bunion. Although wearing shoes that crowd the toes won\'t actually cause bunions in the first place, it sometimes makes the deformity get progressively worse. That means you may experience symptoms sooner. Symptoms Symptoms occur most often when wearing shoes that crowd the toes- shoes with a tight toe box or high heels. This may explain why women are more likely to have symptoms than men. In addition, spending long periods of time on your feet can aggravate the symptoms of bunions. Symptoms, which occur at the site of the bunion, may include: 
<ul>
	<li>Pain or soreness</li>
	<li>Inflammation and redness</li>
	<li>A burning sensation</li>
	<li>Perhaps some numbness</li>
</ul>
Other conditions which may appear with bunions include calluses on the big toe, sores between the toes, ingrown toenail, and restricted motion of the toe.</p>

		<p><strong>DIAGNOSIS</strong></p>
		<p>Bunions are readily apparent-you can see the prominence at the base of the big toe or side of the foot. However, to fully evaluate your condition, the podiatric foot and ankle surgeon may take x-rays to determine the degree of the deformity and assess the changes that have occurred. Because bunions are progressive, they don\'t go away, and will usually get worse over time. But not all cases are alike-some bunions progress more rapidly than others. Once your podiatric surgeon has evaluated your particular case, a treatment plan can be developed that is suited to your needs.</p>

		</table>

		<p><strong>TREATMENT</strong></p>
		<p>Sometimes observation of the bunion is all that\'s needed.A periodic office evaluation and x-ray examination can determine if your bunion deformity is advancing, thereby reducing your chance of irreversible damage to the joint. In many other cases, however, some type of treatment is needed. Early treatments are aimed at easing the pain of bunions, but they won\'t reverse the deformity itself. These options include:
<ul>
	<li>Changes in shoewear. Wearing the right kind of shoes is very important. Choose shoes that have a wide toe box and forgo those with pointed toes or high heels which may aggravate the condition.</li><br><br>
Padding. Pads placed over the area of the bunion can help minimize pain. You can get bunion pads from your podiatric surgeon or purchase them at a drug store.</li><br><br>
	<li>Activity modifications. Avoid activity that causes bunion pain, including standing for long periods of time.</li><br><br>
	<li>Medications. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as ibuprofen, may help to relieve pain.</li><br><br>
	<li>Icing. Applying an ice pack several times a day helps reduce inflammation and pain.</li><br><br>
	<li>Injection therapy. Although rarely used in bunion treatment, injections of corticosteroids may be useful in treating the inflamed bursa (fluid-filled sac located in a joint) sometimes seen with bunions.</li><br><br>
	<li>Orthotic devices. In some cases, custom orthotic devices may be provided by the podiatric surgeon.</li>
</ul></p>

		<p><strong>WHEN IS SURGERY NEEDED?</strong></p>
		<p>When the pain of a bunion interferes with daily activities, it\'s time to discuss surgical options with your podiatric surgeon. Together you can decide if surgery is best for you. Recent advances in surgical techniques have led to a very high success rate in treating bunions. A variety of surgical procedures are performed to treat bunions. The procedures are designed to remove the 쿫ump of bone, correct the changes in the bony structure of the foot, as well as correct soft tissue changes that may also have occurred. The goal of these corrections is the elimination of pain. In selecting the procedure or combination of procedures for your particular case, the podiatric surgeon will take into consideration the extent of your deformity based on the x-ray findings, your age, your activity level, and other factors. The length of the recovery period will vary, depending on the procedure or procedures performed.</p>

		<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Corns and Calluses</strong></font></p>

		<p><strong>WHAT\'S THE PROBLEM?</strong></p>
		<p>A corn is simply an area of hard, thickened skin that can occur on the top, between, or on the tip of the toes. A callus is similar in nature, but is larger and usually occurs across the ball of the foot, on the heel, or on the outer side of the great toe. Corns and calluses are often mistakenly considered a "skin" condition. They are actually the visible sign of an underlying "bone" problem.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DOES IT FEEL?</strong></p>
		<p>Everyone knows that "big oaks from little acorns grow", but few realize that "big aches from little toe corns grow". Calluses and corns quite often have painful nerves and bursal sacs (fluid-filled balloons that act as shock absorbers) beneath them, causing symptoms ranging from sharp, shooting pain to dull, aching soreness.</p>

		<p><strong>LET\'S DO A TEST!</strong></p>
		<p>First, your doctor will conduct a thorough inspection of these areas. He/she may gently trim some of the thickened skin away, in order to rule out a wart (caused by a viral infection of the skin) as the culprit. X-rays will often be taken to identify the specific bone problem that is causing the corn or callus. The doctor may place a small marker on the corn before taking the x-ray, to make it\'s location visible on the x-ray. The finished x-ray will then show the location of the corn and the bone spur underneath that caused it.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?</strong></p>
		<p>Corns and calluses form due to repeated friction and pressure, as the shoe (or ground) rubs against a bony prominence (bone spur) on the toe or foot. The skin thickens in response to this pressure, in order to keep you from getting an open sore or blister. Small amounts of friction or pressure over long periods of time cause a corn or callus. Large amounts of friction or pressure over shorter periods of time cause blisters or open sores. Corns can be due to a buckled or contracted toe position called a hammer toe. Often toes curl under the neighboring toe (especially the smallest toe) causing corns to form. Calluses develop under a metatarsal head (the long bone that forms the ball of the foot) that is carrying more than its fair share of the body weight, usually due to it being dropped down or due to its longer length. Many of these bone conditions are inherited. A poor choice of shoes can aggravate corns and calluses, but often it is not the "sole" cause. (No pun intended)</p>

			<td align="left"><img src="images/calluses.jpg" alt="" width="193" height="241" border="0"></td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>Trimming of this thick skin can relieve the pressure for a short time. You should never consider doing this yourself if you are diabetic or have poor circulation. If you cut yourself, you may cause an infection. Corn pads and callus removers often have harsh acids that peel this excess skin away after repeated application, but they can cause a severe chemical burn, which might lead to infection and greater pain than the original foot condition....so be careful with self-care. You can begin by soaking your feet in warm soapy water and gently rubbing away any dead skin that loosens. A pumice stone, buff bar or emery board is then use to "file" this thickened skin. This should be done gradually, a bit a a time, ideally after each shower or bath. Attempting to file off the entire thickness of a corn or callus can result in a burn or abrasion. Applying a good moisturizer such as Vitamin E oil, cocoa butter, or lanolin to the hardened areas should keep them softer and relieve pain. Non-medicated corn pads or moleskin (a thin fuzzy sheet of fabric with an adhesive back) can be purchased to protect corns and calluses, but should be removed carefully, so you do not tear the skin, and should only be worn for a day at a time.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT WILL MY DOCTOR DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>After an initial history and physical exam of your feet, x-rays will be needed to tell the whole story and determine why corns and calluses are developing. Your doctor is the expert in trimming down these areas of thick skin and will often apply comfortable padding to these painful corns and calluses. Special padding devices and materials may be available only from your doctor for your use at home. Medication for inflammation may be utilized to treat the underlying injury and sometimes a cortisone injection into the underlying bursal sac will be recommended to rapidly reduce pain and swelling.<br><br>

Changes in shoewear may be recommended. A prescription custom-made device called an orthotic might be made to wear inside your shoes, to redistribute pressure more evenly across the ball of your foot. A pad placed in your shoes (called a metatarsal pad) may help reduce your contracted hammer toes and relieve pressure on the ball of the foot as well. Often corns and calluses will have to be trimmed on a regular basis to prevent them from hurting. Eventually, you may desire corrective foot surgery by your podiatrist to straighten curled or contracted toes for corns or elevate and shorten metatarsals for calluses. Often such surgery represents a short term inconvenience to your lifestyle, but will not require any lengthy period of rest or inactivity. Many satisfied patients have remarked that surgery to remove the bone beneath the corn hurts less the very next day than on a painful day walking in their shoes with the corn present.</p>

		<p><strong>CAN I PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?</strong></p>
		<p>Often changing your style or size of shoes may help. Carefully review the shoes in your closet. Check their fit and discard any that have seams and stitching over painful corns or have worn out innersoles that offer too little protection for calluses on the ball and heel of your foot.<br><br>

Make sure shoes are wide enough for your feet and have enough depth in the toe area to allow minimal pressure on the toes. To demonstrate whether your shoes are of adequate size and shape, place your foot on a blank sheet of paper and trace the shape of your foot. Then, place the shoe in question on top of your foot tracing. You may be surprised, as are many people, that your shoes are actually smaller and narrower than your feet. Try to imagine the forces present in that shoe when you squeeze your foot into it and then walk at any speed. Ouch!<br><br>

Review the socks in your drawer. If they have thick seams at the toes or holes, it\'s time to go shopping. Try to choose natural materials such as cotton and wool. Several types of socks (such as Thor-lo brand) have a double thickness in the toes and heels to protect these areas. Nylon hose can be purchased that have a woven cotton sole on the bottom of the foot to offer less friction and more padding.<br><br>

Corns and calluses almost always persist until corrective surgical measures are taken, so don\'t become discouraged if your efforts to prevent them are less than successful.</p>

		<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Plantar Warts<br>(Papilloma, Verruca Plantaris)</strong></font></p>

		<p><strong>WHAT\'S THE PROBLEM?</strong></p>
		<p>A plantar wart is a small skin lesion that resembles a callus and is found on the bottom of the foot or toes. The term "plantar" doesn\'t mean only farmers get them. "Plantar" means they occur on the bottom surface of the foot. It is usually under 1cm diameter, but can occur in clusters and be much larger. Sometimes a single larger wart is surrounded by many smaller warts. In this case, they are called mosaic warts.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DOES IT FEEL?</strong></p>
		<p>A plantar wart feels like a lump under the foot. They are only painful is they are squeezed or pinched from side to side, or if you bear direct weight on them. Warts on other parts of the body, such as the hands, grow elevated above the skin\'s surface. We bear weight on warts on the bottom of the foot, so they get flattened and pushed into the skin. Most people liken this to walking with a rock attached to the foot, as the thickened callous tissue becomes hard and painful as it gets bigger.</p>

		<p><strong>LET\'S DO A TEST!</strong></p>
		<p>A plantar wart can usually be diagnosed by your doctor based on a characteristic appearance alone. When the doctor trims the hard callus tissue from the surface of the wart, a pattern of small black dots that are actually small blood vessels that feed the wart, is usually seen. The doctor will also test the wart by pressing directly down on it, and then pinching it, squeezing it from side to side. Most warts won\'t hurt when pressed directly down, but are very painful when pinched. If these findings are present, no further testing is necessary to identify a plantar wart.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?</strong></p>
		<p>All warts are caused by the Papilloma virus, a slow growing virus which invades the skin. The viruses are common in all of our environments and they don\'t readily grow on intact skin. But if there is a break in the skin, like a scratch or thorn penetration, this gives the virus the opportunity to get in and start growing. The virus only grows in the epidermis, the thick layer of the skin closest to the surface. It doesn\'t invade the dermis, the deeper layer of the skin. However, the epidermis and the dermis are closely entwined, and the dermis under the wart grows extra blood vessels and nerves in response to the virus infected cells above it in the epidermis. It is because of these nerves that the wart hurts when pinched and because of these blood vessels that it stays well nourished enough to grow. The virus particles can spread from the main wart, along the cutaneous (skin) nerves, to begin growing remote or satellite warts at a distance from the original site. If enough of this spread occurs, mosaic warts result.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>Over the counter products that contain the ingredient salicylic acid may be tried if you have good blood flow, good feeling in your feet, and the wart is small. However, their use is slow and frustrating. They are acids which slowing destroy the wart from the surface down. Diabetics or other people with numbness or bad circulation should not use these products, as it can be dangerous for them. You may also try treating the wart by keeping it covered with tape at all times. This seems to prevent the wart from growing as rapidly and may be of some benefit when combined with other treatment. The thick callus tissue can be carefully removed with a pumice stone or file. This must be done in between applications of the salicylic acid medicine.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT WILL MY DOCTOR DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>Your doctor has a number of choices for treating your Plantar Wart. Unfortunately, warts are stubborn entities and even the best methods for removing them allow a high rate of reoccurrence, around 15%.<br><br>

He/she may choose to use medication that is stronger than what is available at the pharmacy. This can speed up the process. Depending on the size and number of warts, treatment can take from 1-4 months before the wart is completely gone, and like any infection, all parts of it must be completely eliminated, or it will grow back.<br><br>

Your doctor may choose to use an oral medicine called Tagamet (Cimetadine) or an ointment called Efudex (5-fluorouracil) on the wart.<br><br>

An additional option is to physically remove the wart at one time, either surgically, with a spoon like instrument called a curette, or with the CO2 laser. The healing time is from 2-4 weeks, depending on the size. Use of the CO2 laser reduces the rate of reoccurrence to 10%, reduces post-operative pain and eliminates any bleeding.</p>

		<p><strong>CAN I PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?</strong></p>
		<p>Keep your feet clean and dry. Inspect feet frequently for new warts and begin treating small ones immediately, before they increase in size or number.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT\'S THE PROBLEM?</strong></p>
		<p>A bone spur is a prominence of the bone that can often cause irritation to the overlying skin. This "spur" can be an irregularity of the shape of the bone or can be a small outgrowth of bone or cartilage. If this prominence or "spur" is in an area that is prone to pressure from shoes or from the ground during walking, it can become symptomatic and begin to cause discomfort. A bone "spur" can exist and cause no discomfort, if it is not in an area that is irritated by pressure from walking, shoes, etc. Often, the skin overlying the bony prominence can be irritated from shoe pressure or from walking and can result in a build up of skin commonly known as a corn or callus, depending upon the location.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DOES IT FEEL?</strong></p>
		<p>Patients can feel discomfort while in shoes if the bony prominence is on the top of the foot or on the toes. If the prominence is on the bottom of the foot, discomfort can be present at any time that the patient is weightbearing, such as walking, running, etc. If the prominence is located on the top of the foot or toes, it can often be felt as a hard lump overlying the bone, and below the skin. If there is a skin lesion present, such as a corn or callus, the bony prominence can usually be felt directly under the skin lesion.</p>

		<p><strong>LET\'S DO A TEST!</strong></p>
		<p>A thorough examination of the clinical signs and symptoms will result in a diagnosis by the treating doctor. To help assess the extent of the problem, the exact location of the bony prominence and the size of the prominence, standard x-rays are utilized. This will allow the doctor to determine the best course of treatment for the patient. A metallic indicator marker may be taped to the corn or callus prior to the x-ray. This will be visible on the developed x-ray and will help to correlate the location of the corn/callus and the underlying bone spur. In some instances, additional tests such as MRI\'s or CT scans may be indicated. If the doctor believes that there may be some additional involvement of soft tissue structures such as tendons or muscles, an MRI would be used to help visualize these non-bone structures. A CT scan may be used to determine other characteristics of the bony prominence that may not be adequately visualized on standard x-rays. However, an MRI and CT scan are usually not necessary, and standard x-rays coupled with a thorough examination are usually enough to begin a treatment regimen.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?</strong></p>
		<p>The bony prominence can develop several different ways. The prominence may simply be an irregularity in the shape of the bone as the bone developed. It can also result from chronic irritation to the bone in that area. An injury to the bone can also result in a prominence at the site of injury, which results from irregular or excessive healing of the bone. Additionally, the prominence can occur as a result of a tendon or ligament pulling on the bone. This causes an irritation to the outer covering of the bone and a bony prominence develops. Spurring of the bone can also occur as a result of arthritic changes or narrowing of the joint. When the opposing joint surfaces begin to press into one another, the bone proliferates and causes spurring. The bony prominences or spurs often have overlying callus type lesions from the irritation from walking or the pressure caused by shoes on the bony prominence. The tissue that forms is the body\'s way of protecting the skin, and is commonly known as a corn or callus. As the irritation continues, the callus or corn will become thicker and thicker, resulting in increased discomfort and pressure. These corns and calluses are simply thick skin, and do not have "roots". These lesions will recur again and again if either the bony prominence is not removed, or the irritation from wearing a tight shoe or walking is not eliminated.</p>

		</table>

		<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>Avoidance of tight shoes is the single most significant action a patient can take to relieve the pain from corns associated with bone spurs, and often, the most difficult for the patient to reconcile. Our choice of shoes involves not only considerations of our foot health, but also style, fashion and our self image. All these factors should be weighed and when painful foot problems develop, more consideration should be given to comfort than style.<br><br>

Corns from bone spurs can be gently and gradually removed at home. After soaking the feet in warm water with a mild soap added, file back and forth over the corn with an emery board. This needs to be done regularly and often, to keep up with the rate of growth of the lesions. This can be dangerous and should not be attempted by persons with diabetes or those with poor circulation.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT WILL MY DOCTOR DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>Your doctor will explain the cause of the underlying problem and offer you various treatment options. There are both conservative and surgical options for this condition. The simplest treatment options often result in considerable and immediate relief. The painful corn or callus can be "trimmed" with little or no discomfort. The hard outer skin is simply and painlessly removed. After removal, a pad can be applied to limit the pressure over the bony prominence. Suggestions may be made regarding change of shoes, pads, inserts for the shoes or over the counter products that may be helpful. If conservative treatments are not successful, if if the lesions reoccur at an unacceptable rate, surgical treatment is recommended and is aimed at removing the painful bony prominence. This is usually performed under local anesthesia at various locations, including the office, surgical center or hospital.</p>

		<p><strong>CAN I PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?</strong></p>
		<p>Sometimes recurrence of the painful skin lesion can be prevented. This can often be accomplished by simply eliminating the pressure causing the discomfort. This can be via the use of pads, shoe inserts or change of shoes. The use of over the counter chemicals which "dissolve" the painful lesions is not recommended and can often result in complications or infections. Most importantly, pain and discomfort are your body\'s signals that a problem exists. Prompt attention and treatment can often result in significant relief with the avoidance of complications.</p>

		<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Hammertoes</strong></font></p>

		<p><strong>WHAT\'S THE PROBLEM?</strong></p>
		<p>Hammertoe is the general term used to describe an abnormal contraction or "buckling" of the toe because of a partial or complete dislocation of one of the joints of the toe or the joint where the toe joins with the rest of the foot. As the toe becomes deformed, it rubs against the shoe and the irritation causes the body to build up more and thicker skin to help protect the area. The common name for the thicker skin is a corn. At first, this thick skin helps reduce irritation to the bone prominence, but as the skin becomes thicker, it adds to the pressure from the shoe. Periodic trimming of the corn may give temporary relief. However, over a period of time, a bursa may develop and if it becomes inflamed (bursitis), the area becomes red, swollen and painful. It may also become infected.<br><br>

There are two joints in the lesser toes and one joint in the great toe. If the deformity occurs in the joint nearest the nail, it is called a mallet toe and the corn will usually develop on the tip of the toe. This is due to the pressure being on the tip of the last toe bone rather than at the fat pad under the tip of the toe. If the deformity is at the other toe joint, or where the toe joins the foot, it is called a hammertoe and the corn will occur on the top of the toe. Corns may also develop between toes. These are usually due to a rotation of the toe, rather than a contraction (buckling). This can cause the joints to rub together and may create small bone spurs that cause corns in a similar manner. Do not confuse corns with calluses that occur on the bottom of the feet. They are generally caused by other conditions, although a severe hammertoe may create downward pressure on a metatarsal bone at the ball of the foot, and add to the cause of a callus.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DOES IT FEEL?</strong></p>
		<p>A hammertoe may be present but not always painful unless irritated by shoes. One may have enlarged toe joints with some thickened skin and no redness or swelling. However, if shoes create pressure on the joint, the pain will usually range from pinching and squeezing to sharp and burning. Cramping in the toes, foot and leg may develop from the muscles and tendons functioning in abnormal positions because of the deformed joints. In long standing conditions, the dislocated joints can cause the pain of arthritis.</p>

		<p><strong>LET\'S DO A TEST!</strong></p>
		<p>The diagnosis of hammertoes is initially made by a simple exam of your feet. X-rays may be necessary to evaluate the severity and type of deformity. Additional lab tests may be necessary to rule out infection or other medical conditions.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?</strong></p>
		<p>Although there is little doubt shoes are responsible for causing corns, the size, shape and other characteristics of our feet are hereditary. The contraction and/or rotation of toes can be the result of poor mechanics of the foot, resulting in over-pronation. This results in low or flat arches, which cause the muscles and tendons of the foot to twist the toes and joints away from their normal position. High arched feet (over-supination) can also result in similar conditions. A severe bunion may cause a hammertoe, as the great toe twists over or under the second toe, causing it to dislocate. Shoes cause the corn, as the bony top of the toe rubs on the toe box of the shoe, but the underlying problem is the abnormal position of the toe joints, which may be hereditary. The crooked toe is irritated by shoe pressure on the joint or spur. As a result, the skin becomes thicker to form a protection. The thicker the skin, the more pressure and eventually, a bursitis under the corn may develop. This causes the joint to become red, swollen and painful. Additionally, the skin can break down and become infected.</p>

			<td align="left"><img src="images/hammertoe2.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="165" border="0"></td>
		</tr>
		</table>

		<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>The most important thing is to purchase well fitted, comfortable, low heeled shoes that do not irritate the crooked toe. Also, make sure your stockings are not tight, causing the toes to contract. High heel shoes should be worn at a minimum, as they cause the tendons of the toes to pull them up into an contracted position. Tennis type and walking shoes have significantly decreased the complaint of many people with hammertoe deformities. Although the crooked toe is still present, it may not hurt if the shoe is large enough.<br><br>

<strong>BATH TUB SURGERY IS NOT A GOOD IDEA!</strong> Trimming corns with a razor blade may give temporary relief, but is dangerous, as you can cut yourself and cause an infection. Non-medicated pads from the drug store do give relieve from shoe pressure and are helpful. However, if the toe becomes red and swollen, consult with your family podiatrist right away.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT WILL MY DOCTOR DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>Your doctor will examine you and make a differential diagnosis. That is, decide what type of hammertoe you have and rule out other medical conditions. Treatment may range from more appropriate footgear to periodic trimming and padding of the corn. Cortisone injections may be indicated if a bursitis is present. Antibiotics may be utilized in the presence of infection. Removable accommodative pads may be made for you. If conservative treatment is unsuccessful, surgical intervention may be suggested. In the early stages, when the toe joints are flexible, this may involve a minor procedure, such as cutting or lengthening the tendons to straighten the toe. If the toe is relatively straight and the corn is caused by pressure on a spur, the enlarged bone may be remodeled and the spur removed. In more advanced cases, when the joint is dislocated, part of the bone at the joint may be removed.<br><br>

Temporary pins may be used to keep the toe straight while it is healing. Sometimes, the removed bone is replaced with a synthetic joint implant, to straighten the toe and help it function properly.<br><br>

Most of these toe surgeries can be performed in the office or the outpatient surgery under local anesthesia. Sometimes you can wear sandals after surgery and other times, a special stiff soled shoe is used so you can walk right away.</p>

		<p><strong>CAN I PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?</strong></p>
		<p>After either conservative treatment or surgery, follow your doctor\'s orders, which may include advice regarding proper footgear, minimal use of high heel shoes, accommodative padding, or an orthotic worn inside the shoe to balance and improve the function of your feet.</p>

		<p align="left"><font size="3"><strong>Plantar Fasciitis</strong></font></p>

		<p><strong>WHAT\'S THE PROBLEM?</strong></p>
		<p>Plantar fasciitis/heel pain syndrome is an inflammation of a thick band of tissue at the bottom of the foot called the plantar fascia. The inflammation of the plantar fascia, at it\'s origin at the heel bone (calcaneus), causes the classic symptoms of pain at the bottom and/or side of the heel facing the opposite foot, often the most painful upon arising in the morning or when standing after sitting for prolonged periods. We call this post-static pain...pain after rest. This is because the plantar fascia is tight after rest, and the stretching inflames the painful area even more, therefore increasing the discomfort. The pain can exist with or WITHOUT a "heel spur". It is the feeling of most physicians that treat this condition often, that the pain is caused by the stretching and inflammation of the plantar fascia, and NOT by the bone spur. The spur is a result of pulling of the plantar fascia at the heel bone, resulting in proliferation of bone, often referred to as a "heel spur".</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DOES IT FEEL?</strong></p>
		<p>The classic symptoms are pain and a feeling of stiffness in the bottom and/or side of the heel. This pain is often a sharp pain that is described as a feeling of stepping on a stone or nail. The pain often reduces after a few steps, though it may still persist. This pain can also occur when walking after sitting for a prolonged time, such as sifting at work, driving a car, etc.</p>

		<p><strong>LET\'S DO A TEST!</strong></p>
		<p>A thorough examination by a doctor of the clinical signs and symptoms will usually result in a clear diagnosis. X-rays will usually be taken to determine if any abnormality is present in the heel bone (calcaneus). On occasion, fractures, bone cysts, or foreign objects (pieces of metal, splinters, broken needles, glass) can be discovered as the cause of heel pain. If the presentation is not clear, other diagnostic tests may be utilized. Bone scans are often used if a bone cyst or abnormality in the bone are suspected or if a fracture is suspected. An MRI may be performed if a small "stress" type fracture is suspected. Additionally, an MRI is useful in determining the status of the surrounding tissue and can determine if there is a tear of the fascia or any other soft tissue and bone abnormalities. A CT scan is useful when suspecting a fracture of the heel bone and the extent of the fracture. Additionally, blood tests can be utilized to rule out arthritic or infectious disorders.</p>

		<p><strong>HOW DID THIS HAPPEN?</strong></p>
		<p>Plantar fasciitis heel pain syndrome can occur via a myriad of causes. Risk factors such as weight gain, foot type (flat feet, high arched feet), a high level of activity, sports, overuse, improper shoegear, improper support of the feet, trauma, tightness of muscles and daily activities can trigger the classic symptoms. Often, there is no single cause, but a culmination of several risk factors. It is imperative to address all of these factors to treat this condition successfully.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT CAN I DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>Switching shoe gear to a well supportive running shoe can be effective. Reducing your level of activity helps. When you are off your feet, the injury is healing, it\'s getting better. When you are standing with inadequate foot support, it is getting injured. An orthotic or arch support can support your foot well enough to virtually eliminate the injury that is occurring while standing and walking.</p>

		<p><strong>WHAT WILL MY DOCTOR DO FOR IT?</strong></p>
		<p>Your podiatrist will perform a thorough examination and history of your condition. He/she will explain the cause of the problem and offer you various treatment options. X-rays will usually be taken to assess the status of the heel bone (calcaneus) and to check for other findings such as arthritis, foreign objects, fractures, etc. There are numerous treatment options, and the treatment protocol will vary according to the severity of the patient\'s symptoms.<br><br>

Treatment options can include oral anti-inflammatory medications, heel cushions, heel cups, physical therapy, stretching exercises, taping/strapping of the foot, over-the-counter inserts, custom orthoses, injections, soft tissue wraps, weight loss, change of shoes, casting, night splints and surgery. Each option has advantages and disadvantages, and must be tailored to the needs and unique characteristics of each patient.<br><br>

Conservative care is successful 85% of the time, and surgical treatment is usually performed 5-10% of the time. The surgical techniques differ according to the surgeon\'s preference. The surgery is usually performed as an outpatient and can be performed "traditionally", with removal of the spur and surgical release of the ligament, or via newer techniques utilizing endoscopic equipment. This newer technique utilizes two very small incisions and surgically releases a portion of the plantar fascia, and the "spur" is left undisturbed. The technique utilized should be discussed with the patient and will depend on x-ray and clinical findings.<br><br>

<a href="?sec=shockwave" class="bodyBlue" title="Shockwave Therapy Information">ESWT-extra corporeal shock wave therapy is a newer method that utilizes sound waves/shock waves to help alleviate the pain associated with plantar fasciitis. This method has been used in Europe for many years and has been used in the United States for the past 2-3 years. ESWT is presently an FDA approved modality for plantar fasciitis. Althought there are only a limited number of doctors performing this procedure, it is becoming more widely available. As a general rule, ESWT is an excellent alternative to surgery for those patients that haven\'t responded to approximately six months of conservative therapy with no relief of symptoms.</a></p>

		<p><strong>CAN I PREVENT IT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN?</strong></p>
		<p>Controlling body weight, wearing supportive shoes and having additional support in your shoes can decrease the chance of recurrence. Additionally, stretching the Achilles Tendon and hamstrings and maintaining flexibility are extremely important in preventing recurrence of the problem. Most importantly, pain and discomfort are your body\'s signals that a problem exists. Prompt attention and treatment can often result in significant relief with the avoidance of complications.</p>
