		<p>Introducing Prayer Belts, the Fashionable New Way to Express Faith in a World Doing Everything Possible to Stop You.</p>

		<p>Prayer Belts were created <strong><em>by people</em></strong> deeply troubled over the systematic removal of prayer from public life <strong><em>for people</em></strong> who share the common desire to express their faith in public.</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Allow Prayer in Public School?  Sorry!</li>
			<li>The Ten Commandments in the Courthouse?  No Can Do!</li>
			<li>The Nativity Scene at City Hall during Christmas season?  Absolutely Not!</li>
			<li>Teach Intelligent Design or Creationism as alternatives to The Theory of Evolution?  Never!</li>
		</ul>

		<p><strong>Our Mission is to Spread the Word, Strengthen the Commitment among the Faithful, Attract the Attention of the Un-Churched, Re-Engage the Curiosity of the De-Churched, and Create Excitement with a Fun, Fashionable New Way to Pray.</strong></p>

		<p><strong>Our goal is to equip parents, young adults, teens, boys and girls - anyone of good faith - with a new weapon in the daily battle to profess faith in everyday life.</strong></p>

		<p>Prayer Belts embroiders a faith-affirming message onto a color-fast web-style belt and turns a common fashion accessory into a personal banner for displaying faith in places where such displays are often discouraged or prohibited.</p>
